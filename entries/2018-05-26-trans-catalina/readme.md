# Trans-Catalina Trail

Since moving back to Los Angeles from an extended stay in New York I’ve been out in the forest often. I was there frequently before leaving, too, but it’s different now.

While away I began reading about through-hiking, making your own gear (MYOG), literally watching people just walk around mountains, all to supplement the extreme lack of open undeveloped space. Researching hikes to do once returning home led to rediscovering a multi-day hike across Catalina Island, located just off the coast.

<!-- more -->

Never having attempted a multi-day hike before, and having little camping experience, there were all kinds of assumptions surrounding how involved an attempt would be. Living in semi-rural Tennessee and unschooling when young didn’t provide a wide variety of offline activities. Days were spent online for several hours. One of my favorite alternatives was going on (really) long walks through undeveloped subdivisons.

![Gradating from subdivision to moved earth in suburban Tennessee (Google Maps)](sutherland_50.png)

We lived on the edge of one such development. Walking to the end of the road resembled scrubbing a frozen infrastructural timelapse. First houses, then houses without roofs, then houses without siding, then frames of houses, then foundations, then street signs and sewer covers, then paved road, then smoothed dirt, leading to raw abandoned piles of moved earth.

A hard coordinate where the bubble burst.

Between those long walks and doing healthy day hikes while living in Los Angeles, it seemed likely any surprises before making it home were solvable, especially with my friend [Jon](https://jongacnik.com) doing it with me. (s/o Jon for a bunch of these photos, too!)

## Preparation and Booking

Normally there is a two night minimum stay for campgrounds. To bypass this, simply call the Two Harbors visitor services to book your campsites. Tell them you’re doing the Trans-Cat. They’ll walk you through campsite selection. Talking to someone for 15 minutes is much more enjoyable than clicking around the site’s interface.

![Intricately traced SVG created by Jon](tct.svg)

We departed on May 8th to complete the trail in three nights / four days. [Blackjack](https://www.visitcatalinaisland.com/camping-boating/primitive-camping/blackjack), [Two Harbors](https://www.visitcatalinaisland.com/camping-and-boating/two-harbors-camping/two-harbors-campground), and [Parsons Landing](https://www.visitcatalinaisland.com/camping-boating/primitive-camping/parsons-landing) are the standard camps for the TCT. With it being our first go prevailing wisdom won out.

Both Blackjack and Two Harbors have potable water on site. For Parsons Landing you’ll want to reserve a locker with 2 gallons of water and firewood. You can do that at the Guest Services building in Two Harbors. Between booking the campsites and the ferry tickets, it was somewhat expensive compared to a typical trip. Definitely worth it, though.

Also, to be comfortable, keep your pack weight down. I was just a little shy of 20lbs at the trailhead, and am aiming closer to 15 next time. For more on my pack just scroll down the page.

## Day One, Avalon → Black Jack, 15 miles

We took the 6:30am Catalina Express from Long Beach. Leaving that early on a weekday didn’t require booking tickets beforehand, though there are few reasons not to.

It takes around an hour and a half to traverse the San Pedro channel. Once arriving in Avalon we waited around to check in, but it turns out this isn’t necessary as the permit is only for the stretch between Two Harbors and Parsons, but a paper map is nice to have, even if there are little Instagram icons all over it.

![Avalon with all it’s infrastructure](01-climbing-out_75.jpg)

It quickly became clear that most of this first day is simply escaping the infrastructure surrounding Avalon. The up is very up at the start, and it’s mostly on fire road. Approaching a small shade structure around mile 3 we saw some kids, and when saying hello they asked “Did you know you can smoke sage?” Sick.

Before too long we were crossing our first bison gate. Oh yeah, there is a generously sized bison population on Catalina, introduced to the island during the [20s for a silent Western film shoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalina_Island_bison_herd).

![A weather station managed by LAFD](02-jk-weather_133.jpg)

![“Here be bisons”](03-jk-fence_133.jpg)

Not much time passed before spotting it; our first bison, relaxing near the edge of a pond, maybe 40 feet from the trail. It’s suggested you stay at least 75 feet away from bison to prevent spooking them.

We decided to go off trail.

This gives the TCT an entirely unique angle. When approaching a blind corner of the trail obstructed by foliage might be a bison ready to trample your ass.

Not long after our first encounter, while approaching a blind corner, I caught what appeared to be a glimmer of bison rear-end making it’s way in our direction… We scrambled up the hill, and sure enough, there it was.

![The access road we avoided scrambling down to](05-trail_133.jpg)

![“o u want to pass? lol”](05-bison_133.jpg)

This ensured we were properly paranoid for the rest of the trip whenever approaching blind corners. It was like hiking in Jurrasic Park, but instead of velociraptors there were lumbering furballs with horns.

After a few brief siestas to rest and snack we approached a sizable hill where three or four *more* bison were hanging. Unable to determine if the trail passed within the Bison Bubble (75ft) we continued ahead. It became clear that, yes, the trail ran directly adjacent the bison and within The Bubble. The trail followed a ridge line, requiring either a scramble down an uncomfortably large cliff to an access road, or inch along off trail until clearing the crest of the hill past the bison.

Forward was the way to go.

Cresting the hill, we realized the three or four bison was more like twenty-five or thirty. A few were even laying *directly on the trail*. These things live to fuck with hikers.

![“Yeah let’s just chill here lol”](06-bison_75.jpg)

The next few miles were super hot. After having started at around 8:30am we had done seven-ish miles and it was about noon, putting us square in the middle of the island at the bottom of a valley with very little air circulation.

We made it up the last little bit of trail and got to camp. Ate some cold-soaked lunch (no stove to keep weight down) and walked around the camp, which was entirely empty save one other solo hiker.

After a minute it became clear there was a *lot* of bison shit around camp, which got me a little anxious about waking up in the middle of the night to a stampede. I digress. 

![Roasting](07-jon_133.jpg)

![Campsite #1 at Blackjack](07-camp_133.jpg)

With sunset approaching, a quick walk before dinner sounded good. Following the path out of camp we’d take tomorrow morning led to an expansive view. Looking to our right we noticed a small structure which seemed to have *the best* view.

Upon approaching the structure we were greeted by, yeah, you guessed it, another bison giving guard. Fuck! We headed back to camp as the fog rolled in. In the next life I want to come back as a bison on Catalina.

![“Yo check out this vista lol jk”](08-bison_133.jpg)

![Sunsplosion](10-sunset_133.jpg)

![“ViBez”](09-fog_75.jpg)

After getting a fire going I finished setting up camp. This was the first time I pitched the self-made tarp, which uses two trekking poles and tension from tie-outs to stay taught. Was happy to find it worked. Aside from the satisfaction of making something, the possibility to modify and improve a project from knowing the construction makes it worth the time investment. There were already a few small adjustments to make once home.

### Tips

1. Don’t get too discouraged by the amount of infrastructure and fire roads. Tomorrow is much better. Just get to camp and enjoy the down time.
2. We didn’t realize it, but there is a point to fill up on water halfway through the hike. Check the map before setting out.
3. Campsite number three has pleasant shade in the afternoon.

## Day Two, Black Jack → Two Harbors, 12.5 miles

The day started with Jon tapping on my tent. “Not to freak you out, but there is a bison right next to the campsite.”

![“o u want to sleep? lol”](11-bison-camp_75.jpg)

It kept distance for a while until disappearing. I wandered around the campsite—it couldn’t be found, but after several minutes there was a loud “HRUMPH.” It had wandered behind the tree in our campsite (pictured above), and started walking towards us, conveniently oblivious (as bison usually are) to the fact that we weren’t ready to leave.

We grabbed the last few things off the table as we were casually chased out of camp.

The first two miles of day two takes you down a canyon where a currently dry stream sometimes runs, providing a water source for the densest foliage we had yet encountered. A quick jaunt back up through fields of cactus brings you to The Airport in the Sky, infamous for it’s bison burger. I guess there has to be a payoff for flying into the airport, and that’s entirely condensed into (arguably) one of the best burgers I’ve ever had—the ultimate [$100 hamburger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/$100_hamburger).

![Down and up to the airport](12-jon_133.jpg)

![Hanger walk](13-airport_75.jpg)

After properly smashing the burger it was time to put the boots (or trail-runners) back on the trail. Soon a fire road gave way to some welcome single-lane trail. Little Harbor came into view before too long, and speculation began flying about where the trail continued after that. Spotting a shade structure perched high above the valley, peaking in and out of cloud cover created by the sea-breeze rushing over the cliffs, it looked, as they say, “hella steep.”

![“Oh shit look at this thing up ahead just out of frame”](14-jk_133.jpg)

![Walking walking walking](15-jon_133.jpg)

![Winding down towards Little Harbor](16-little-harbor_133.jpg)

Little Harbor was pretty amazing; a secluded pair of coves with particularly calm waters. We kicked it for around 30 minutes, wanting to hop in, but knowing we needed to stay on schedule for the day. Ended up skipping stones most of the time. Tbh could spend the rest of my life just skipping stones.

![At this point ready for a break](17-jk_133.jpg)

![We were the only ones there on a Thursday afternoon](18-little-harbor_133.jpg)

After our siesta we headed off towards what appeared to be a considerable climb. Turns out it was. When hiking the TCT you experience a bit over 10,000ft of aggregate elevation change. This checks out considering the amount of ups and downs. The climb took us past areas of massive erosion, the Pacific swallowing up the coastline as huge chunks of cliff collapse, some taking sections of trail along with them.

![Crumbling catci](19-forward_133.jpg)

![Do not hike with your eyes closed](20-jon_133.jpg)

![“Oh shit look at this thing up ahead again”](21-jk_75.jpg)

As we approached cloud-base it *really* began to feel otherworldly, or at least no longer like a short ferry ride away from every day life in Los Angeles. Up ahead was the shade structure spotted earlier, where we gladly caught our breath and snacked as the clouds rushed past and threw undulating patterns of sunlight on the valley below.

![Very up](22-up_133.jpg)

![Hitting cloud base](23-jk_133.jpg)

![Shade structure ahoy](24-jon_133.jpg)

Beginning the descent into Two Harbors, the naming became clear when the vantage point provided a view of the narrow strip of land separating two harbors upon which the small town sits.

![Almost to Two Harbors](25-two-harbors_75.jpg)

![Camp for the evening](26-camp_75.jpg)

We ate and drank at the single restaurant open on weekdays. Most overheard conversations revolved around how long the year-round residents and staff of the bar have lived on-island. After eating 10x our capacities the half-mile walk back to camp felt longer than the climb earlier.

I set up my net-tent sans-tarp to have a view of the harbor and evening sky. While dozing off I heard some footsteps. It was a small (and grotesquely adorable) Catalina Fox, staring at me, perhaps 15ft away. Closing my eyes again, it took only a few minutes before the sound returned, this time the fox’s face literally pressed against my net. Clearly this called for a photo. Awakening my phone the bright screen instantly startled the fox, and it yelped the most high-pitched and panicked yelp as it high-tailed it out of sight.

### Tips

1. Eat a light breakfast and scarf down a burger at the airport, even if it’s only 10am. You’ll be glad you did.
2. Pace yourself up the climb after Little Harbor, it’s deceptively long. Fortunately the air is much cooler here than the valley.
3. If staying at Two Harbors, try to get campsites #1–5. They’re right on the water. #6 is next to the toilets. Skip that. #11 is nice, and where we ended up, as the wind was really howling at the first 5 and we didn’t want to wake up in the harbor.

## Day Three, Two Harbors → Parson’s Landing, 7 miles

Breakfast came and went quickly, followed by a stop at Island Services to pick up the permit and reserve our locker with water and firewood for Parsons Landing. Seeing as there would be a fire, we grabbed some bites from the grocery store for grilling later that evening.

You start the trail on day three back-tracking briefly down a road the first mile past a small port at the other harbor. Our timing coincided with a barge bringing supplies to town, and several trucks drove past, throwing dirt into the air. The industry, though modest, was such a contrast to the previous morning.

![The “welcome to hell” part of the hike](27-hell-hike_133.jpg)

![Fire road, but level fire road](28-trail_133.jpg)

The first three miles go UP. *FAST*. You’re totally exposed and it’s hot as hell. You’re so miserable you can’t help but appreciate how bad it is. Nothing redeeming about this, other knowing it’ll be over soon.

After the worst of it things start to level off, and we were pleasantly surprised to spot cloud cover forming over the cliffs ahead, a welcome reprieve from the direct sunlight that had just fried us.

![](29-jon_133.jpg)

![](30-jk_133.jpg)

![](31-trail_133.jpg)

A few miles pass and you’re up there. [Stony Peak](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/ds_mark.prl?PidBox=DY3012) is the second highest point on the west side of the island, the first being Silver Peak. This was such a welcome break form the climb up, and we hung out in the clouds for a while. Good thing considering how intense the trail down to Parsons was about to be.

![“Oh shit look at it”](32-jk_133.jpg)

![Descending to Parsons, knees on fire](33-parsons_133.jpg)

Simply put, the way back down is, as they say, “hella steep.” My tarp-tent requires two trekking poles, and this was the only section of trail where both were useful while hiking to stabilize. My knees are glad I did. The views were absolutely unparalleled while looking back up towards the peak we had just descended from.

![Looking back up towards the peak](34-peak_75.jpg)

Just prior to arriving at Parsons there is a plaque for the Propst Prarie.

> Dedicated to A. Douglas Propst, a transplanted Colorado grass man who came to Catalina Island in 1953 and spent the next forty years restoring the island’s ecosystem. His labor of love helped insure this native landscape.

This got me thinking about the internet as landscape, or open space within network infrastructure. The internet was once a wilderness, but has been over-developed, and because of this we’ve lost areas to simply exist. Tools for sharing photos have turned into platforms for sharing things that more closely resemble personal ads. Tools for communicating with friends are used to extract taste profiles and create filter bubbles to encourage constant consumption and endless engagement. I wonder what a conservationist movement for the open web could look like, and if there is room for analogue efforts to Propst’s preservation of the Stipa Pulchera grasslands for the connecting together online.

![s/o the grass man](35-grass-man_133.jpg)

![Tarp pitched for shade](36-tarp_133.jpg)

We got into Parsons. The verdict? Totally amazing. Our campsite was on the sand, maybe 10ft from the Pacific’s edge. Each site is denoted by small rock structures to assist in the persistent against the wind. I pitched my tarp low and we spent the rest of the day relaxing intensely.

![Max chill](37-beach_75.jpg)

![Tarp pitched for sleep](38-yo_75.jpg)

The fire turned out great despite the breezy conditions. Eight dogs and tomato paste down. We turned in after finishing the whiskey and hoped for the best come morning.

### Tips

1. Don’t get too discouraged on the way out of Two Harbors. Yeah, it sucks, but you’re headed towards remarkable areas.
2. Kick it up top, no need to rush.
3. Bring trekking poles for heading down to Parsons—shit is no joke!
4. Ensure your tent is properly staked with heavy rocks once at camp. The wind really picks up as the sun sets.

## Day Four, Parsons → West End → Two Harbors, 16 miles

Technically, the terminus of the TCT is at Parsons, but this is a recent revision. The original end is at Starlight Beach, another 4 miles out towards the western tip of Catalina. After packing up camp we decided to drop our packs in one of the metal food boxes, bring some water and snacks, and head for a quick 8 mile jaunt to West End, which is, yeah, the end of the island out near Starlight.

![Looking forward towards Lands End](40-lands-end_133.jpg)

![Looking back to camp at Parsons](39-parsons_75.jpg)

The hike out was super pleasant and a bit overcast, making things cool off. A very mellow last day. Approaching Starlight the trail makes a rapid descent. We decided against that and continued along to an unmarked side-trail heading towards the very tip of the island.

![“Oh shit it’s the end”](41-lands-end_133.jpg)

![Variegated moss along the cliffs](43-moss_133.jpg)

![A bald eagle reservation prevents you from going further](42-lands-end_75.jpg)

It was impossible to comprehend the scale of the landscape there, all collapsing into the water. After hanging for a while we hiked the 4 miles back to camp, picked up our packs, and continued on the additional 8 miles of dirt road to Two Harbors, where we’d catch the 9:30 ferry back to San Pedro. It’s a deceivingly long 8 miles, as two harbors always appears quite close, however the coves send you in and out a few times, making it seem to take forever. The drizzle turned into rain. It was a nice way to end the trip.

![One of many coves on the way back](44-cove_133.jpg)

![Catalina Fox](45-fox_133.jpg)

![The final mile marker](46-mile_133.jpg)

There isn’t a sign commemorating the end of the TCT, you just end up back in Two Harbors, which feels a little funny. Overall, super satisfying to have completed the trail, and we celebrated with more food and drinks at the single restaurant. One drink which stood out was the “Bison Milk.” You’ll have to experience it for yourself. The patrons we had seen last time were now staffing the bar, and the staff were now patrons.

We waited around for the ferry, for what ended up being a somewhat miserable return trip with it being a smaller ferry at night (no horizon line) and choppy waters (properly raining.) Despite this, damn, solid first through hike.

### Tips

1. Definitely hike out to Lands End. Follow the trail to the left you’ll spot from about where the trail forks off to Starlight. Much more enjoyable considering Starlight is a rocky little beach, and the trail is super steep.
2. DO NOT have a few drinks, a burger, “Bison Milk”, and onion rings before boarding the ferry back. It’s rough.

## Thoughts

This was the ideal first through-hike. You’re never more than a few miles away from help, and not once did I have to dig a hole and shit in it. Quite easy in that sense. We definitely packed the miles on, though. The TCT itself is 38, but we did closer to 48 going out to Lands End.

Generally speaking:

1. Keep your pack weight down, but don’t go crazy. Try to stay under 20lbs.
2. I brought two Smart Water bottles, each holding one liter. This was plenty, as you can always re-fill at least once a day. Just ask for a map in Avalon and check it in the mornings.
3. Don’t bring more than two days worth of food, as you can eat at the airport the morning of day two and resupply that night (or the next morning) at the grocer in Two Harbors.
4. If you want to do a two-day version, take the ferry from San Pedro to Two Harbors. Hike Two Harbors to Little Harbor and camp there, then do the return hike the next morning. A ton of climbing, but it’s the best stretch.

Having seen Catalina from Los Angeles for so long, I’m glad to have gotten out there, even if it took a while. A good reminder to simply go for it and then begin figuring out the details.

## Equipment

Ok, a quick rundown of what was brought. While in New York I started to research ultralight gear. I got very into it. What really got me going was the Make Your Own Gear (MYOG) community. My first project was a [Ray-Way backpack kit](http://www.rayjardine.com/ray-way/Backpack-Kit/index.htm).

![Drawing and cutting out the patterns](47-pack_133.jpg)

![Making the straps and back](48-pack_133.jpg)

![The front pockets assemblies](49-pack_133.jpg)

![The bottom corners, terrifying but ok](50-pack_133.jpg)

For $70 they ship all the material and expertly crafted instructions on how to assemble the pack. Amazingly it weights only 9.5 ounces once complete. Having never touched a sowing machine before, this was a great first project to learn from.

![Completed pack](52-pack_133.jpg)

![The back (v proud of the straps)](53-pack_133.jpg)

Sure, it took around 20 hours to make considering my novice experience, but it provided the confidence to then sow the [Yama net-tent kit](https://www.yamamountaingear.com/net-tent-kit/). That was quite simple, although it made apparent how clear the Ray-Way instructions were, as these were lacking somewhat. Still, nothing was unsolvable without a few moments to consider what was happening structurally.

Between those two projects I gained confidence to order some material from [Ripstop By The Roll](https://ripstopbytheroll.com/) and improvise a tarp tent off the dome after a little research. Not many photos of these last two projects, as it was mostly a bunch of jumbled fabric and the nerves distracted from documentation.

I highly suggest giving this a try if you’re interested. It is economical, unless your time is ultra-precious, and even then the knowledge acquired will far outlast the gear you’ve created. The understanding of production provides you with better judgment for any future purchases, too. Making this sort of stuff feels different than a typical DIY project, as it employs advanced technical fabrics and sometimes complex geometry. It’s super fun to learn new shit.

I’ve collected some resources used to create my projects in an [Ultralight MYOG channel on Are.na](https://www.are.na/jon-kyle-mohr/ultralight-myog). If you have any questions feel free to [drop a note](mailto:contact@jon-kyle.com).
