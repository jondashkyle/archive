# Mount Whitney

Like most trips, there is an option for the drive between San Fransisco and Los Angeles: the scenic route or the fast route, depending upon your disposition.

The former takes you meandering along what is often labeled “the most scenic stretch of highway” in North America, assuming of course the road hasn’t collapsed into the Pacific during one of the frequent landslides, creating a state of seemingly perpetual repair.

The latter provides an expedited corridor via Interstate 5—colloquially “The 5.” Novel the first few times, perhaps if viewed abstractly as an 800 mile line endlessly terminating just out of sight for example, but ultimately a route lined with franchise convenience and designed for speed, traffic willing.

My trance when driving this stretch only subsides while passing the Sierras, distant, but their peaks in view for a while to the east. This was as close as I had gone, although I found my head wandering there when reading up on the John Muir Trail as a source of frequent afternoon escapism.

You can imagine my excitement, after returning from the [Trans-Catalina Trail](/entries/2018-05-26-trans-catalina), when a trip began to form around summiting Mount Whitney. At 14,505ft not only the tallest peak in the Sierras, but the entire contiguous States. My anticipation stemmed not from it being “the highest”, but simply an excuse to finally visit those mountains regardless of the superlatives.

## Preparation

Although never having visited the Sierras, they’ve played a critical role in my living in Los Angeles. Leaving LA headed north along The 5 an anomaly appears just before crossing the San Fernando Valley border. Cascading down the hillside is the [Los Angeles Aqueduct](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Second_Los_Angeles_Aqueduct_Cascades,_Sylmar.jpg). The annual snow melt makes it’s way to the Owens Valley, where a substantial volume enters the aqueduct to be transported hundreds of miles south to Los Angeles for drinking water, as famously depicted in [Chinatown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(1974_film)).

Seeing as none of us had winter mountaineering experience, like self-arresting with an ice axe, this trip was planned to coincide with that annual snow melt. A funny habit of checking the Mount Whitney Forum every other minute developed in the weeks leading up to the trip. When the snowpack is still deep the primary ascent is via the chute, a few thousand feet tall, quite steep, and prone to turning into a hellish ice slide.

Despite that it’s entirely manageable, but in part due to the popularity of the summit by being the tallest it’s not uncommon for people to be plucked off the mountain in compromised condition due to inexperience. Not only that, some climbers in the weeks leading up to our visit became involuntary human projectiles and took out a group below by failing to properly self-arrest. As if becoming a statistic is not enough, the risk of unwittingly contributing to the tally because of the negligence of others wasn’t an enticing prospect.

This in mind, our only plan to summit involved taking the ninety-nine switchbacks up from trail camp provided enough snow had found it’s way off the peak and into the valley. Luckily a few days before departing some folks from [Altra](https://www.altrarunning.com/) reported the all clear. Nice.

Our permits allowed us to split the trip over two nights. This provided adequate time to acclimate to the increased elevation, and cuts the summit hike from 22 miles to 7—making it an overall more enjoyable experience.

## Getting There

Our route out of Los Angeles largely paralleled that of the aqueduct, with one brief divergence. After leaving the LA basin behind us for the open desert past Palmdale I looked down and did a double take. Before leaving for any trip I compulsively re-pack my belongings several times to ensure everything is there. Sure enough, the pack was fine, but I had forgotten to put on my hiking shoes!

A quick search led to a Dick’s Sporting Goods, the only viable option provided the uncertainty of if there would be anything suitable between here and Whitney.

Our trip up The 14 took us past a number of geologically fascinating areas. Just a week before I had caught a lecture at [Mount Wilson Observatory](https://www.mtwilson.edu/) by accomplished geologist [Tanya Atwater](http://emvc.geol.ucsb.edu/1_DownloadPage/Download_Page.html), who has contributed immensely to research on plate tectonics, specifically around southern California and the San Andreas fault. She mentioned often taking fellow geologists to the northern terminus of The 14—just off the highway are seemingly frozen snapshots of [undersea fissures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_volcano) bubbling up out of the desert floor.

![c:1/7 r:75](01-jk_75.jpg)

![c:7/13 r:75](02-jk_75.jpg)

Before too long we arrived in Lone Pine, a town located at the base of Mount Witney, and clearly centered around supporting the associated activity. We spotted an airstream trailer with the words “Ultralight Backpacking” on the rear. Sure enough, it was fully stocked with all the best equipment, including Altras. I grabbed a pair of Timps, merino toe socks (why the hell not?), and placed the pair from Dicks back in the box. Huge shout out to [2 Foot Adventures](https://2footadventures.com/)!

![r:75](06-jk_75.jpg)

We met up with the rest of the group for dinner at Bonanza then headed up to Whitney Portal at 8,364ft. The plan was to acclimate to the elevation over the next two days leading up to summit to avoid acute mountain sickness. With camp setup we went to sleep without much fuss.

### Tips

1. Speaking of scenic routes, take The 2 to Upper Big Tujunga Rd instead of The 5 to The 14.
2. Keep an eye out for the Mojave DWP building.
3. Keep your pack weight down; every pound counts and you’ll be glad you did tomorrow.
4. Don’t forget your shoes ffs.

## Day One

The day began by breaking down camp and heading to the Whitney Portal Store for breakfast. Jon ordered a pancake the size of a medium pizza and about as thick as your fist. We made our way to the trailhead after securing the permits to our packs, gave them a weigh (I was 24lbs fully loaded w/ water) and started the 7 mile hike to trail camp.

<div class="imgs-auto">

</div>

Things start off amongst the pines, still dense at this altitude. Streams of snowmelt from several-thousand feet above provide abundant water, and when mixed with the shade create extremely lush pockets of ferns and resident insects.

<div class="imgs-auto">

![Ferns](12-jg_133.jpg)

![Evidence of snowmelt](12-jk_133.jpg)

</div>

As the sun continued rising so too did the heat. The base of the mountain is located in the desert where it was quickly approaching 100°F. Even with the altitude we were feeling it, especially as the treeline approached and the trees and shade thinned out.

A fork in the trail went to Lone Pine Lake. Although not in the plan for today, we did intend to visit this on the return trip. The water looked incredibly inviting.

<div class="imgs-auto imgs-wide">

![Log hoppin](13-jk_133.jpg)

![Lone Pine Lake](14-jg_133.jpg)

![Green gives way to granite](15-jk_133.jpg)

</div>

As the trail ascended each turn seemed to out-do the last. Maybe this was an effect of accumulation, but the “wow”s did not stop.

One thing was becoming clear: there was going to be a lot of water on the switchbacks tomorrow, ultimately a good sign—indication of ample snowmelt which gave us some confidence considering the range of reports online.

<div class="imgs-auto">

![Through the marsh…](16-jk_133.jpg)

![…and the stream.](19-jg_133.jpg)

![Mirror lake](20-jg_133.jpg)

</div>

Passing through the treeline the altitude was becoming apparent. A dull headache. We took a break adjacent the first sizable trailside snowbank. It’s difficult to grasp size out here. Metaphors of scale fail to accurately portray the magnitude. The artist [Michael Heizer](http://doublenegative.tarasen.net/), known for his massive earth works, dismisses the notion of scale in his work in favor of size, scale being relative and size being absolute.

Hours of hiking behind us, the peaks in the distance still appeared just as large as they did that morning, which I suppose to say they were “as tall as mountains in scale.” Tomorrow was going to be involved.

After the meadow we crested a ridge and damn, Consultation Lake is gargantuan. A little exploring was a must, and revealed several campsites along the bluff. Knowing we were near trail camp, and how that tends to get crowded, we opted to stay here for the night.

<div class="imgs-auto imgs-wide">

<div class="imgs-auto imgs-wide">

![The view out the front door of camp, not bad](26-jg_34.8849748.jpg)

</div>

After setting up camp there were a few hours to kill. Despite the excessive weight of a hardback book, I couldn’t resist bringing [Aereality by William Fox](http://www.counterpointpress.com/dd-product/aereality/), whose work often explores how cognition transforms land into landscape. 

The reflexive sense of sublimity when zoning out at landscape around us subsided only when falling asleep that night, the silence sometimes broken by the roar of jet engines overhead. Military training flights out of Edwards AFB to the south-east. First you’d hear them, and only after a few moments of of listening would you be able to estimate the direction they were heading. Spotting them required tracing that perceived path across the sky some distance to catch up with the speed at which they were moving, and if you were lucky they’d come into focus.

<div class="imgs-auto">

</div>

We turned in early to thoroughly rest up before departing for the switchbacks at 6am the next morning.

### Tips

1. For sure stop by the Portal Store for breakfast. If the flapjacks tickle yr fancy consider splitting with a fellow hiker.
2. Save Lone Pine Lake for the return trip—the move is to get camp setup sometime in the afternoon to afford a few hours to simply hang out.
3. Trail camp can get busy, consider setting up at Consultation for a nice alternative which puts you perhaps 20min from the switchbacks in the morning.
4. There were plenty of places to fill up on water along the way. Bring whatever you consider to be proper capacity for a full day tomorrow, but today simply filter as you go. Less weight yo.
  
## Day Two

After an alright night of sleep the day began at 6:00am. Our packs were significantly lighter, only bringing the necessary food, water, and an extra layer. We headed from Consultation up past Trail Camp, where quite a few people had already gotten going.

A quick break to double check the time, 7:20am, and we started up the first of ninety-nine switchbacks towards Trail Crest.

<div class="imgs-auto">

![Starting the switchbacks](33-jk_133.jpg)

![Sunset](34-jk_133.jpg)

![Summit at right](35-jg_75.jpg)

</div>

A few miles later we had our first snow crossing. These areas were well packed and simple to traverse, although a quick glance at the rocks below was enough to reinstate appropriate caution. This became most exaggerated when approaching the cables. Reports from the days before ranged from requiring crampons and ice axes to bare boots and trekking poles—we found it to be somewhat closer to boots and poles.

Seeing as yak-traks were in our packs, we paused to attach them to our shoes and gauged the quality of the snow. Very slushy, good for the traks to grip into. Jon headed off first and made it with no issues.

<div class="imgs-auto imgs-wide">

![First snow](36-jg_133.jpg)

![The Cables](37-jk_133.jpg)

![Almost there](38-jk_133.jpg)

![Towards Trail Crest](39-jk_133.jpg)

</div>

Following the cables was a lot of “up.” Each switchback increasing our field of view in ways perceptually disproportionate to the amount of additional elevation.

Our pace was pretty good, and we started gaining on a fellow hiker. As the spacing decreased we heard the sweet-nothings of EDM bangers. *Holy shit do speakers on trail bother me*. Two things came to mind:

1. Perhaps I should bring a few pairs of cheap headphones, and upon encountering sonically insensitive hikers say “hello” and ask, “would you like a pair of headphones to better appreciate the fidelity of your tunes?” Passive aggressive, yeah, but come on…<br><br>
2. When visiting the beaches of Southern California the composer John Cage would become annoyed by people endlessly blasting their portable radios. To overcome this agitation Cage composed a piece entirely out of radios simultaneously playing an array of stations. In this way, whenever visiting the beach, he would pleasantly encounter one of his own compositions and no longer feel the pang of intrusive melodies.

These thoughts behind (and below) us the elevation became more noticeable as the end of the switchbacks came into view. Just one more snow crossing at the top of the chute and we’d be at Trail Crest.

<div class="imgs-auto">

![Down the chute](40-jk_133.jpg)

![Approaching the end of the switchbacks](41-jk_133.jpg)

![Trail Crest](42-jg_133.jpg)

</div>

Trail Crest really lives up to the name. Approaching the ridgeline, focused on the horizon in front of you, sky gives way to the interior Sierras beneath you. It feels infinite up here despite being firmly planted on granite.

The temperature was hovering around the mid-40s and the winds really picked up as we followed the trail along the edge of a *large* cliff into the valley below. Putting the puffy on felt just right, and the fresh views helped renew our sense of “holy shit” after a few hours on the switchbacks.

<div class="imgs-auto">

![Interior Sierras](43-jk_133.jpg)

![Owens Valley](44-jk_133.jpg)

![Impossibly big](45-jk_133.jpg)

![Jon with summit in sight](47-jk_133.jpg)

</div>

This section of trail also takes you past several crags which create “windows” through which you can see the Owens Valley on the opposite side. As with many details of this trip, the size was immense, and impossible to communicate through imagery.

The entire Whitney Trail is class one, meaning relative ease and no scrambling sections, but this should not discount the effects of elevation, and the last couple hundred feet you’re really sloggin it up. As the hut came into view a wave of excitement began to surge as it became clear we’d summit.

<div class="imgs-auto">

![Crags](49-jk_133.jpg)

![One of several “windows”](50-jk_133.jpg)

</div>

There were perhaps 30 people hanging out at the top—an interesting mix. There were the climbers, who had just scaled the east face and made my little jaunt up feel extremely pedestrian, and the Instagram models posing in varying states of undress, connecting to the burst of LTE signal beamed up from Lone Pine.

It was a weird scene, and I began thinking about this all as backdrop for social media. The themes I read yesterday in Aereality about the transformation of land (environment) into landscape (image) crossed my mind. Similar to how an environment like this summit is subject to the same range of ecological crisis affecting me at home despite distance, so too does the cognitive pollution and associated behavior of platform technology follow me even here.

The connectedness was acute. How strange to feel so removed from my everyday, hyper-saturated by media, but find myself just as embedded within it.

![“We up here”](54-jg_75.jpg)

After about half an hour at the summit we began our way back to camp. It felt nice to descend after two solid days of nonstop up. The change in light was noticeable, and the air had cleared up a bit. Views, though familiar, felt new with the this fresh perspective.

<div class="imgs-auto">

</div>

Just before reaching Trail Crest the Whitney Trail intersects the Pacific Crest Trail, and here hikers often drop their packs for the two miles up to the summit. Nearing this juncture I saw a few crows hovering in the heavy winds—impressive. Approaching, it became clear they were getting up to no good by getting into people’s packs. There was also a super fat marmot. Can’t say I blame them.

The rest of the way down was smooth and we reached the bottom of the switchbacks at 3:20pm. Not bad.

<div class="imgs-auto">

![“wut”](62-jk_133.jpg)

![Last bit of snow](63-jg_133.jpg)

</div>

Rather than heading directly back to camp we decided to go relax on the edge of Consultation Lake. A lush ravine revealed an easier way down the otherwise jagged and difficult terrain.

The water was almost freezing, literally. Just before our arrival to Whitney this had been frozen over. We challenged each other to see who could keep their feet submerged the longest, the loser clearly owing the winner a beer when reaching Lone Pine.

Being no [ice man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUQwFZ_xFdM), I lost after about 30 seconds.

We turned in early after dinner, both from exhaustion and as the winds were significantly higher than yesterday. From camp above we could see the gusts of wind tracing over the lake below, a sort of real time visualization of air masses making their way down to the Owens Valley.

<div class="imgs-auto">

</div>

### Tips

1. Leave early, it gets hot down at the switchbacks in the mid-afternoon. We saw some people heading up quite late, and not only will you be sweating on the way up, you’ll be rushing to get back down before the winds pick up during sunset. 
2. Don’t take the chute unless you know what you’re doing, for real. Don’t jeopardize yourself or those around you.
3. Keep your pace in check, although sleeping at elevation helps you’ll certainly begin noticing it. We talked to a few people who turned back at Trail Crest and I can’t help but wonder if this was because the effects of altitude were exaggerated because of speed.
4. Don’t fall off the top.

## Day Three

We slept in a bit, ate breakfast, and broke down camp. The additional weight of the tent back in the pack didn’t feel great, but it was good to know the day was all downhill.

<div class="imgs-auto imgs-wide">

![Down past the meadow](71-jk_133.jpg)

![Towards Lone Pine Lake](72-jg_133.jpg)

![Sunrise](69-jg_75.jpg)

![Apenglow](70-jg_75.jpg)

</div>

As planned, we stopped by Lone Pine Lake. The water was perfect, and we spent quite a bit of time both relaxing by it’s edge and wading around. The surface of the water constantly rippled due to the sheer number of trout swimming around. This area does not require a permit, and I’m certainly planning on visiting again to camp sometime this summer.

<div class="imgs-auto">

![Lone Pine Lake](74-jg_133.jpg)

![Blue all around](73-jg_75.jpg)

</div>

The last few miles went quickly. Looking around me to take in the last moments of the trip the crumbling granite appeared in motion. What looked to be still was actually falling to the valley below, albeit on a geological timescale. 

After finishing the hike and reaching Lone Pine we stopped at Merry-Go-Round, a Chinese spot located in a wood-paneled octagonal structure with a central column clad in mirrors and a $10 afternoon buffet that I absolutely wrecked myself on. 5/5 stars.

<div class="imgs-auto">

![Straight to LA](77-jg_133.jpg)

</div>

Following the aqueduct back to Los Angeles I thought about how the time had passed simultaneously slowly and quickly. What had been a three day trip felt like both *three weeks* and *three minutes*, and continued to make me want to better understand my own sense of time passing.

Back at home I spent the next few days completing an update to [Hardly Everything](https://hardlyeverything), a project meant to effect the passing of time in how it relates to our habits of consumption online by introducing cycles and cadence to the feeds we use everyday.

## Digest

It was difficult to gauge how extensive Whitney is prior to leaving as there was a range of involvement described in trip reports leading up to our departure. People do get injured, and we said hello to a few people who did need to turn back because of complications with the altitude.

In general, if the snow has melted, you’re doing greater than ten mile hikes semi-regularly, and can summit over two days, I doubt you’ll encounter any issues.

This in mind, it was rather crowded. While the permit system does help to keep numbers down, I had an awareness of my own effects on the ecosystem around the trail. The feeling of appreciation for something you’re contributing to damaging (in aggregate) are complex to navigate. Everyone should spend time there, but if practical that would of course create irreversible harm as is already happening on a smaller scale. 

No good answers there, apart from promoting best practices such as leave no trace, etc… and if you do check it out, be sure to stay on trail (or at least on granite) and pack out your wag bag ffs!
