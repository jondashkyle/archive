Russia is [disconnecting from the global internet for a day](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-internet-disconnect-what-happens/).

There are many reasons an individual may want to disconnect today. This may be through an act of “deleting your account[^https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/delete-your-account]” or going offline altogether for a period. Yes, you should own your data. Yes, you should be free from surveillance. Zooming out, it is easy to see why nation states want this, too.

Perhaps choosing to stay connected is motivated by the possibility of doing to others what it is you’re looking to avoid. For the nation state this is mostly surveillance with a dash of misinformation, and sounds similar to reasons why an individual may choose to keep their account.

To see what others are doing.  
To tell others what you are doing.

In aggregate it’s a source of burnout. Your own behavior reflected and amplified back at you. The irony is not lost here.

Is the future nation a closed network? Will you be required to obtain a passport to traverse other networks? How does identity fit into this? Borders defined by protocols.
