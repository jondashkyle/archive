Russia is [disconnecting from the global internet for a day](https://www.wired.com/story/russia-internet-disconnect-what-happens/).

There are many reasons an individual may want to disconnect today. This may be through “deleting your account” or going offline altogether for a period[^1]. Yes, you should own your data. Yes, you should be free from surveillance. Zooming out, it is easy to see why nation states want this, too.

Perhaps choosing to stay connected is motivated by the possibility subjecting others to what it is you’re looking to avoid. For the nation state this is primarily surveillance with a dash of misinformation. This intent could be reflected in why an individual may choose to keep their account, though clearly with less malice.

To see what others are doing.  
To tell others what you are doing.

In aggregate it’s a source of burnout. Your own behavior reflected and amplified back at you. The irony is not lost here.

Is the future nation a closed network? Will you be required to obtain a passport to traverse other networks? How does identity fit into this? Borders defined by protocols.

[^1]: The possibility to disconnect in a hyper-connected period is itself a privilege.
