The other day I caught a screening of Wilm Wenders’ *Notebook On Cities And Clothes* at [Now Instant](https://now-instant.la). The film follows Yohji Yamamoto as he prepares for an upcoming show and begins with Wilm commenting on image and identity.

Released in 1989, right as we began to go online en masse, the observation has crystalized over time. Life on the screen, life of the screen, life in the screen…

Who are you but a representation of who you imagine yourself to be?

It is difficult to not become an ad when the platforms we use to connect are ad networks. Going against the algorithm creates friction. Think about it too much and the temperature rises. I really don’t want to be an ad.

A nice thing about websites dying off is they’re no longer effective forms of advertisement. There’s no built in audience. A shout into the void when it seems like we’re all shouting at each other.

[Peer-to-Peer Web](https://peer-to-peer-web.com) series had ran its course. A few false starts with other projects have briefly followed. Most circling around questions of identity.

Instead of giving it unnecessary importance Wilm’s remarks summarize my conclusion:

> YOU’RE LIVING HOWEVER YOU CAN.  
> YOU ARE WHOEVER YOU ARE

I disabled the sites for *Why* (wwhhyy) and Diffuse. Cleaned things up around here on my personal page. We’ll see how it goes. Thanks for being here.
