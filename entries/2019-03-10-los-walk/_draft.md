## Ideas

- Transposing an activity from one place to another
- A typical day on a long duration walk, lifted from wilderness and placed on urbanization
- Transition pulling you through environment
- Live, using Instagram stories
- Human Exclusion Zones, as depicted in *Machine Landscapes: Architectures of the Post Anthropocene*.

> The most significant architectural spaces in the world are now entirely empty of people. The data centres, telecommunications networks, distribution warehouses, unmanned ports and industrialised agriculture that define the very nature of who we are today are at the same time places we can never visit. Instead they are occupied by server stacks and hard drives, logistics bots and mobile shelving units, autonomous cranes and container ships, robot vacuum cleaners and internet-connected toasters, driverless tractors and taxis.

- Los Angeles as proto-machine landscape, designed for the human driven car.
- Placing myself in these zones, like needing to divert my walk down Sepulveda past LAX because of the tunnel lacking pedestrian walkways, then walking down aviation blvd with it’s deteriorating sidewalks in the midst of a concrete desert—lots where airport employees park their cars.
