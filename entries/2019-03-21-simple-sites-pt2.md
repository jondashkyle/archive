# Simple Sites pt.II

Never one to leave well enough alone, I’ve made some changes around here since [last time](/entries/2017-12-27-sites). As always, it the is not the technology itself, but what it affords which is important. These affordances are not constants, and as the technology has changed over time so too has my position.

I’ll quickly elaborate on the what, and then get into the why.

This site is deployed with [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/) (frontend). It’s built with [**Vue**](https://vuejs.org/). The repositories are hosted with [**Github**](https://github.com).

Compared to the last stack, this appears sort of normie, but shares the same set of goals. Those being archivability, portability, and understandability. Perhaps we can add immediacy too, a choice based on avoiding certain types of friction, and could be blamed on my own impatience.
