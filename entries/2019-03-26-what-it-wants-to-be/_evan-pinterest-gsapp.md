- “Hopefully not a parable”
- “It has been interesting to watch your evolution, and the school has for the past decade really embraced this idea of expanding practice and how architecture thinking and design can be brought to other fields, and certainly you have done that with Pinterest and beyond.

> Architecture is about shelter, about the human, and I think in technology it’s easy to forget sometimes who you are building for, because you do not see them or interact with them. But so having that body memory, that the point of all of this is people in the end, is really powerful, and thats something I learned here.

> GSAP: Another aspect that i think, for me is quite architectural, and we’re so inindated iwth images, and of course pinterest is about images, but youve talked about moving beyond this 2D aspect of an image, and talking abotu ways of registering a story about how an image or an object or the place it represents came to be. … How do we move beyond this two dimensionality?

> E: Coming to realize the last 6, 12 months, that for a lot of people, words are the language of knwoledge maybe, and images are the language of dreaming, and that whats happened with this incredible access to unlimited imagery and visual media, is we’re all becoming fluent in this language of dreaming in a way that has never been possible before, which is changing the way we form our identity, starting to, its changing the way we formulate what we want, from our home and from other parts of our life, and its also disorienting on some level, but its all about images, and theres a dark side to images, which is kind of what you’re alluding to, and that is that they are two dimensional representations of what is really not even a three dimensional thing but really four dimensional thing when you really think about it, and the danger there is we make decisions based on a very shallow subset of the full impact of that decision and it has on your life.

> E: The next frontier, at least for design is the self, is the self, the inner world. It’s the world we don’t have images for. It’s our emotional stability, our spiritual practice. Theres a whole range of dynamics that we experience every day that we don’t even have language for in this culture, and the impact of that is pretty enormous because all of human behavior is driven by how we feel. So without going to deep into it I think thats an incredible frontier.

> GSAP: We don’t talk enough about the poetics, its all about performance. … The idea that cities are going to be “smart” and vs the idea that cities are incredible because you can get lost and not sure exactly who you will meet, or at least used to. The serendipity of encounter and hybrid conditions and maybe there is a way we have to reembrace a surrealist approach through technology as opposed to use technology to be positivist.
