## Draft

Both in my own work and in the work of others there is often a question on my mind: *What does it want to be.*

Picture the sculptor discovering form in the material at hand. It requires a sensitivity to what’s present beneath the surface. The sculptor is an actuator, an extension of the hammer, getting out of the way and responding to whats there.

This doesn’t just happen. The hyperawareness of the novice gives way to lucidness through cultivation over time. An acute ability to follow one’s nose.

I’ve lived and worked with an internet connection most of my life. Within my practice there is a constant tension between what appears obvious and what is implied. There are no easy answers to the question of what technology wants, especially at scale, but a certain few speculations on the question stand apart from others.

[GSAPP](https://www.arch.columbia.edu) is Columbia’s architecture and urbanism graduate program.





When asking what technology wants to be it’s easy to adopt a lazy accelerationist position.
