# Day Nine

![r:75](2019-04-27.jpg)

The night had been windy, leaving the tent flapping in my face as tensioning was kept to minimum due to a sandy site. Waking with the sun, the day began trending downhill. Nervous about having kept others up with the sound, everyone said they had slept right through it.

By 10am 12 miles were down—felt good. A water cache was a surprise, having not been marked on the map. A welcome sight in the middle of a hot day.

Shortly afterwards Mary’s place appeared ahead, a nice refresher after the chaotic atmosphere of Mike’s. Mary has set up a shade structure tiny library, and 500 gallon water tank for weary walkers. Big thanks to Mary!

The next stop was the Paradise Valley Cafe, an 8 mile push which included perhaps the steepest section of trial yet, a nice precursor to San Jacinto a few days away. Another nice moment; rocks arranged to mark mile 150. They’re starting to go by faster and faster now.

Arriving at Paradise Valley I ordered a burger (supposedly the best on trail, true so far) and vanilla shake. Although my appetite was as large as the day’s elevation change, I could not finish it, and took it to go for lunch tomorrow.

A few of us went back to the trail head and made camp, making for an easy start at sunrise.
