# Day Seventeen (Zero)

![r:75](2019-05-05.jpeg)

My first zero! No miles walked today. Instead I spent it with Lily at a cabin. I also purchased some new socks. We ate some Thai, and again my eyes were bigger than my stomach.

The weather forecast for tomorrow was a bit disconcerting; rain starting at 11 and developing into thunderstorms over the afternoon. Hmmâ€¦ maybe stay for one more day. As always, the best times are had with Lily.
