# Day Twenty-one (In McDonalds)

![r:75](2019-05-09.jpeg)

([Suggested soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOw62EREnCg))

The past few days when asking others about their intention for the day distance has been measured in a new unit of measurement: distance from McDonalds.

Long distance walking paths have taken form as pilgrimage trails for as long as organized religion. It only makes perfect sense that within late capitalism in America we are motivated to walk hundreds of miles to devour calories scientifically refined and corporately branded. It is with this in mind that I placed my shelter in my pack and set out for the remaining 6 miles to the McDonalds in Cajon Pass.

The fog that had enveloped the valley I slept in became denser as I walked the switchbacks up a canyon wall, visibility reduced to no more than a few seconds in time. In the distance a train continuously sounded its horn as it carried containers from the port of Long Beach to midwest distribution centers. Overhead high-voltage transmission lines buzzed as the fog vaporized on contact while carrying electricity to the high desert. The trail guided me directly beneath the trestle structures, the lines barely visible through the haze.

Winds picked up as elevation was gained, the tall dry grass whipping around, a realtime visualization of the intensity and direction of the heavy gusts.

Suddenly I’m staring over the edge of a cliff, seemingly materializing out of nowhere, the bottom obscured in the mist. My limited line of sight almost suggests an infinite procedurally generated landscape taking form just beyond the fog, the landscape parametrically folding in on itself as I continue walking through it.

Many moments on trail feel cinematic, the sense increasing as I near the backlots and GPUs of Los Angeles. The landscape I inhabit at this moment most resembles the Zone of Tarkofsky’s seminal film [Stalkers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB7jVTut3-g), a film as much about obscured landscape as the characters within it. Both the film and I occupy post-industrial landscapes, the only inconsistency of note being the omission of a McDonalds in the Zone.

Cresting the ridge I can hear but not see interstate 15 in the distance, semi-trucks and minivans cresting the saddle between the San Bernardino and the San Gabriel ranges.
