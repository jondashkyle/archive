# Double Zero at Home

I woke up to scattered clouds out my window. After making the call to wait out the forecasted storms at home the patches of blue came as a surprise, but conditions 80 miles away in Wrightwood at elevation weren’t as forgiving.

The standard morning routine of a walk down the street to grab coffee felt strangely performative, as does any habit after an extended hiatus. I ran into some friends there. “Aren’t you doing that hike?” they asked. “Well, so… yes, but.”

Lily and I headed to Blum and Poe to see part two of a survey exhibition of Japanese art from the ‘80s and ‘90s. The room containing a collection of photography by Daido Moriyama and posters by Tadanori Yokoo stood out. Next we perused Arcana and made a quick stop by the Center for Land Use Interpretation, where Lily bought a copy of [In Spoils of Dust](https://www.appliedresearchanddesign.com/product/the-spoils-of-dust/) about the Owens Valley.

Driving the 101 we passed the site of a large structure near downtown. When I had left an array of heavy machines had begun tearing a massive hole in the facade. Only a few weeks later and new construction was already underway in the pit where the building once stood.

The rest of the weekend was relaxed. Sunday was lazy, as it should be. My plan for returning to the trail was to hike Baden-Powell with [Jon](https://jongacnik.com), who I often go hiking with around the San Gabriels—a nice way to get back on trail.
