# An Update on the Updates

Turns out it requires some time to draft and complete a multi-paragraph update each day. After a day spent hiking 12+ hours a break is necessary.

With this in mind, I’ve been compiling extensive notes each evening with the intent to revisit them after completing the trail and publishing them incrementally.

Until then, I’ll be posting updates here and there as stories on [Instagram](https://Instagram.com/jondashkyle). You can also subscribe to my newsletter for a to receive notification when publishing restarts.

The walk has a little exceeded all expectation, and I look forward to sharing it in detail when the time is right.
