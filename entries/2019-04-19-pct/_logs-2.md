Aug 22

- woke up to a very light rain, slept well considering my stuff was damp
- Got going, a decent climb. Got above the drizzle and the clouds began to open up
- The early light refracting off rain drops hanging from the branches. Oregon really shines in the morning after a good rain
- Sisters looking incredible, a series of great meadows. Was stopping to take a photo every 5 minutes
- about 12 miles into the morning shards of black glass began glimmering on the trail—obsidian, tons of it
- The shards turned to entire boulders, to entire hillsides
- The wound of falling water increased, and obsidian falls came into view—water pouring over a reflective wall of obsidian. Amazing. The water from the stream tastes as crisp as the light reflecting off of it, glacial melt from the middle sister
- Exited the LEA and after w few miles Began paralleling the edge of a huge lava field. It became clear the trail traverses this after rounding a bend and staring up a winding path of loose lava rocks at an impressive grade
- We camped 32 miles from our next stop, a youth camp on a big lake—actually called Big Lake. Word had spread of free unlimited dinner, served at 5:30. I anticipated the miles of lava rock would slow us down eneough to impede our chances of making it on time. Standing at the base of the lava field though, I felt a primal urgency to do whatever it’s take to make it on time. “For the carbs!” I yelled and began running up the rocky path.
- I didn’t notice another hiker around 100 yards up trail, and only noticed when passing by him. He had a huge grin on his face and two thumbs up, clearly getting a kick out of my redic sprint
- Made it up to a ridge and had to stop for a moment, an incredible view of Mount Jefferson, three fingered jack, and the remaining miles of lava ahead.
- Ran all of the downhill and level-ish stuff over the next five miles to a lake, the last water source for 16 miles
- Stopped there for lunch and to fill up on 1.5L of water. Attempted to dry out my stuff without much success
- A mix of Duffy trail and lava rack remained before hitting the highway. An observatory built of lava rock was there, but with my fixation on making it for dinner I resolved to come back at a later time to see it on a road trip
- Began the climb up the next lava field toward NAME OF MOUNTAIN. Tough walking, but quite the landscape. Felt like another planet!
- Reached the top of the climb and, naturally, began to descend. The trail was made of pine needles and soft, but after a moment returned to lava rock. Oooof!
- The next few miles meandered uphill thru a big burn zone full of wildflowers before heading back down toward the camp. At this point it was 3:45 with 4 miles remaining—perfect!
- The remaining miles were very mellow.
- Made it to the camp, felt great to sit on a cushioned chair. Ran into a group of Angelinos, have met surprisingly few on trail, but here were four of us all together! Plan to have a post-PCT hang.
- After an hour dinner began. All you can eat curry. I ate all I could eat!
- Hung out until around 9:00, sitting in a soft chair. Perfect.
- Wandered down to a cove and made camp. Things were still rather damp in the bag, but not terrible.
- All around a great day!

Aug 21

- woke up at 5:30, the new normal time as dawn continues to shift forward
- Fog over the lake at sunrise
- Clear morning, although by afternoon the forecast is for rain
- Very subtle ups and downs through dense forest with lush floors and skirting around numerous lakes
- Very easy walking
- Before long the sky began to cloud over
- 10 miles by 9
- Looked at the map and studied an alternate route, again on the original Oregon skyline trail. This one cuts past elk lake, another lakeside resort. If not planning to go there the OST is a good plan, as it avoids some climbs and descents, takes you to a nicely flowing stream, and cuts 4.5 miles of viewless PCT.
- Broke for lunch 2 miles before the junction after having done 18. Right as we stopped it began to rain.
- Caught up with scar and while roll.
- Decided to take the alternate instead of going into elk. A tempting decision with the burger and beer with a roof overhead, but progress is important to finish on time, and these things accumulate.
- No point in avoiding the weather as this will only increase further north and as the year continues.
- Made it to the junction for red hill and hopped on the ost.
- Trail was basically a stream. With it being a rut the water naturally collects and flows the. Lots of bush wacking to avoid standing in ankle deep puddles
- Before long I was totally soaked even with the rain jacket on
- Stopped by the spring to fill up a liter of water
- Continued pushing to connect back with the PCT. Decent amount of climbing.
- As we reconnected the rain began to subside, and we decided to continue pushing
- After a few miles reached a beautiful open meadow with an absolutely stunning view of the three sisters mountains
- Clouds rolling up over the volcanic peaks, amazing
- Really fun stretch through this meadow. Made the rain totally worth it.
- Reached our intended campsite and decided to do another mile to another meadow with water access.
- The clouds broke and the sun lit up the meadow. Found a good campsite and began unpacking.
- Unfortunatelt my pack liner did not keep all the water off my things. Sleeping bag got quite damp in areas. Going to throw out the thermarest liner and simply use a garbage bag at the next stop
- Ate dinner, cold soaked ramen noodles with olive oil and parmessian. Honestly pretty good!
- Pleased with the respectable miles for a day of poor weather. Going to need to do somewhat difficult days like this to finish up on time

Aug 20

- woke up very late, 8:30. So nice. Waking up so early and getting little sl e each night requires a reset eveRyr once in a while.
- Stopped by the store and pumper was hanging outside. He felt similar. 
- bought a pint of ice cream and sat out on the porch. A little worrisome how many hikers have injuries. Shin splints, etc… hoping I don’t push it too hard this far in and am unable to finish by the time I need to.
- Before long it was becoming lunchtime, so I grabbed a beer and a cup of noodles before hitting the trail again
- Began the road walk to the PCT at around 1:30. Timing was quite good as a truck towing a boat drove by “want a lift to the trailhead? Hop in!”
- Trail began with a mellow climb through dense mossy forest. Went past the rosary lakes, which looked super inviting, but had to push on due to the lazy morning
- Continued to climb up a bit and got a nice look back over the rosary lakes and Odell lake. Also had a little reception!
- Descended a bit through a mellow lush area before beginning a decent climb up to NAME.
- The misquitos have nothing on my 100% deet spray
- Made very good time on this, Feeling very refreshed from the sleep
- After cresting the ridge began descending down to Charloton Lake, where I topped off my water.
- Began a mild climb up to Charloton butte, where a burn area marks a fire from the early 90s.
- By this point the sky was patchy with layers of alto-stratus, the temperature was notably cool. The first time on trail where I get a chill in the early evening when the sun is still up
- Great view of the three sisters here, and the burn area contains all sorts of wildflowers
- Passed back into a wooded section, and after a few miles decided to make camp next to Taylor lake
- Very good day, felt good to recharge on sleep

Aug 19

- usual wake up time. Could’ve slept for another hour or two. Very deep sleep.
- Packed up and topped off the water bottles. 10 miles till the next water.
- Today presented an alternative to the PCT—following the Oregon Skyline Trail to Shelter Cove.
- History of the OSTs relation the the PCT.
- Started off down the dirt road and located the turnoff to the trail.
- Very mellow trail, sunlight illuminating the tops of the pines, trending downhill.
- Made it to a dirt road. Was using a single comment from Guthook primarily to navigate as the trail itself was not visible on my map.
- Said that “upon reaching the dirt road you can take either the trail or the road.”
- I started down the trail, which led me to loop back on to the road after perhaps 100 yards, so I simply decided to take the dirt road and drew and arrow with my name for pumper to see as I was ahead of him
- What I failed to realize was by “road” the comment did not mean the aforementioned road, but the road at the *bottom* of the dirt road. A right turn instead of a left.
- not wanting to be impatient I did not check the map when wondering “shouldn’t I be there by now?”, which only got me further in the hole
- I realized only after some substantial climbing and reaching two opposing trailheads which were not mentioned in the comment that this could not possibly be correct
- If I continued on the dirt road another 2.5 miles I’d meet up with the PCT in a saddle, but would then need to climb another 1500ft, and end up with more mileage than the actual PCT by the end of the day
- I sat there for maybe 15 minutes, then pumper came around the bend. “This is sure gonna save some time, huh.” he said. “Yeah, I fucked up.”
- He noticed one of the two trails where we were Headed north, and connected with another trail which would then get us back on the OST around six miles out from shelter cove. Not ideal, but not backtracking, and not as involved as connecting with the PCT.
- Decided to go for it, even though we could not fully see the trail and junctions in the tiles on our offline maps.
- Ended up being a fair amount of uphill, and a number of blow downs due to the relatively low traffic.
- Made it to the junction and took a break for lunch. At this point feeling a bit dehydrated due to missing the planned water source at mile 10. Ironic with all the water in lakes around, but that is stagnant and mosquito laden
- Continued down this other trail and finally reached the OST again. A relief.
- The next four miles were more of the same, but around mile 2 the trail joins up with NAME OF STREAM and the forest becomes quite lush. Some of the most beautiful forested areas in OR so far.
- Made it to shelter cove and there are some familiar faces. One even from day two in trail!
- Unfortunately the restersunt is unexpectedly closed… no burgers or milkshakes for us.
- Downed a pint of ice cream and cracked open a six pack. Hung around on the dock and soaked my feet in the water. So refreshing.
- Got a somewhat limited resupply, but should get me to the next small resort roughly three days away.
- Ate a crummy dinner of two microwave macaronis. Oh well.
- Had a headache for the second half of the day and looking forward to sleep.
- Passed 1900 miles
- The actual ost between the points today was only 20 miles, however we likely walked 26 or so due to the navigational error.

Aug 18

- standard wake up time
- Another chilly morning. If only it would dip below freezing and kill all these misquitos in one fell swoop
- Started off with a very, very flat walk thru those pines. Refreshing start to the day. Was able to keep the puffy on for several miles.
- Made it the 10 miles to the water cache by 9:30. Filled up then began the slow ascent up Mount thielsen
- Some history about thielson here
- Took a lunch break on a ridge with a great view
- Began onward to a spring, best flow in a while. unfortunately the serenity was spoiled by my broken water filter. Perhaps only a quarter of the water I attempt to filter makes is treated and makes it’s way into the bottle
- What followed was a 23 mile water carry to a cache, making the total mileage for the day on the high side
- The next ten or so miles involved uneventful viewless climbs and descents.
- Was surprised to have reached a mild flat area after what felt to be a relaxed climb to reach Tipsoo pass and a sign indicating the highest point in Oregon and Washington.
- Of course this was entirely viewless, with trees surrounding in every side, but fortunately there were a few windows thru brief clearings over the following mile or two
- methuselahs beard hanging from trees
- While descending from the apex the misquitos became more of an issue. The forest thickened again, creating a sense of placelessness.
- as the PCT does, it took me up another climb to a ridge. This was rather nice, as I could make out the horizon through the less dense forest along the steep incline
- Some meandering elevation change along the ridge
- Passed 3000km
- Caught back up with pumper, and before long began the final descent of the day down to the water cache at windigo pass
- Got to camp as the sun began to dip. Set up quite quickly on a less than ideal site due to the abundance of mosquitos and bees.
- A packet of ramen for dinner, felt so good to get the feet up
- Quickly fell asleep after the big day.

Aug 17

- woke up at the usual time
- As chilly as yesterday morning, this was chillier. Certainly feels as though fall is beginning to set in during the early hours, as by afternoon we are back to summer
- Began with a mild climb over a few miles
- After around four miles we entered a substantial burn area, which appeared to have been quite hot as only trunks were left—no branches in sight
- The temperature dropped even more upon hitting a canyon in the burn area.
- The light was phenomenal as it rose 
- Began another mild climb as the pines returned and the temperature increased
- easy walking for several more miles, then reached a trail register where there was a spur trail leading 2.7 miles to the highway.
- Took The pumice flats trail down to the highway for a little shortcut into Mazama.
- True to the name, it was quite flat, and I ran some of it as to attempt catching the 11am shuttle from Mazama to the lodge on the rim
- Got to the highway and walked about a mile before scoring a hitch, amazing! Circled around a picked pumper up a few hundred yards behind me.
- Made it to the village and stopped by the store. Did a modest resupply to get the next 3 days. Also hit a pint of ice cream and got a six pack.
- Hopped the shuttle up to the lodge.
- Grabbed lunch with pumper and another hiker from the shuttle.
- Ordered the fish and chips, which had the highest calorie count. 1640.
- Had an old fashioned which must have been 80% alcohol.
- Hung out for a while, then headed to the rocking chairs overlooking the crater to pack up my resupply.
- Multiple fun conversations with others in adjacent chairs about the trail. One of the highlights of the trail is the relatability of walking. “You walked how far?!”
- Finished packing and walked over to the bookstore and overlook area. Some nice relief maps.
- Began up the rim trail, but first grabbed an ice cream sandwich to go from the cafe while passing by
- The views are substantial. It’s interesting to see something which appears so large, yet is only 6 miles from edge to edge. That distance sounds like nothing in walking miles, but looks so massive when seen as a line from point to point so clearly represented.
- Lots of ups and downs on the trail, the grade far surpassing anything on the pct
- Some phenomenal overlooks, and it was satisfying to circle around wizard island a bit
- As the sun began to set the wind became quite cold. The trail began dipping towards a dense patch of trees at the base of Grouse Hill
- red knotweed glowing in the setting sun. Pretty striking.
- Made it to camp and set up home for the night. Quite an enjoyable evening!
- Mileage is off due to taking the crater rim trail. Actual mileage was more like 26 or so.

Aug 16

- woke up at the standard hour. Pretty chilly morning.
- Began the brief climb, and by 8:30 was running into misquitos pretty heavily
- there are a number of small lakes around and it’s like a breeding zone for them
- Stopped to grab water at a small spring at 10, and just afterwards the misquitos continued to worsen
- Threw my trekking poles on the ground, dropped the bag, and put on my rain gear to keep them off. Not fun in the heat.
- Was in a very very sour mood. Total trance hiking as fast as I could to get thru it.
- Began a climb up away from the lakes and it got a bit more manageable. Took the rain gear off.
- The entire morning had been spent in thick forest, the kind of stuff where you can’t see more than 30ft in any direction.
- Finally on climb some patches open up to reveal a view. Felt like getting a breath of air after being under water.
- Had a few bars of reception and called lily. Such a big morale boost to hear her voice.
- Took a mini snack break when pumper caught up, then got going.
- The trail descended a bit, then began climbing again. some really great views along a ridge of shale. So refreshing!!
- Could see the edge of crater lake. Took another decent break at the ridge before the descent.
- Walked around 1 milemdown to water and a good view, then ate dinner there with the intent of pushing on afterwards.
- The next section is a 20 mile water carry to Mazama village at crater lake. I maxed out my water capacity at a spring where there were what had to have been at least 100 tiny frogs hopping around
- Pushed on to a campsite at the edge of a big burn area, maybe 5 miles
- Made camp and called it an early night.

- good nights sleep
- Are breakfast, broke down camp, and got water from beneath the spillway of the little Hyatt resivior. There was a lot of fog hanging around the water, which was quite warm and had a rather gross taste.
- Began by climbing a few hundred feet through dense younger growth interspersed with trunks from older trees which were cut
- This went on for miles.
- Passed by Hyatt lake and skipped the resort located on the other side around two miles away
- nearing Howard prairie lake the sound of trucks and the beep beep of reverse warning sounds became audible through the tick trees
- Exited The dense growth onto a dirt road adjacent a large clear cut area as a logging helicopter flew overhead
- The next stretch was quite boring. Lots of dead branches on the ground, nothing notable… head down and keep on walking.
- After an 1800ft climb reached a small spring and filled up on water, which is becoming increasingly scarce as the ground turns to pumice and the water flows straight through the porous rock
- After this the forest turned to old growth with thick moss hanging off much of the foliage. Endless ferns underneath. At least this is richer to look at.
- Saw a large group of elk bounding through the thick brush. Theyre big!
- arrived at the south brown mountain shelter at 1pm and stopped for lunch. Had already put in 22 miles.
- The shelter marks the point where 2/3 of the trail is complete for those northbound!
- Filled up on water and continued on for fish lake, where there is a small resort.
- Began to feel a bit claustrophobic in the green tunnel. A real physiological reaction to not seeing any sky for miles on end.
- Began to open up as the trail continues over large lava fields. Huge lava boulders and trail made out of gold ball sized pumice snaked its way up a ridge.
- Some of the last trail to be constructed, and most expensive.
- Finally got a good view of mt mcglochlan, which we were now almost right at the foot of.
- Made it to highway 140. Instead of doing the 2 mile walk to fish lake resort, or trying to hitch, we decided to continue pushing and do another few miles
- Sat next to the stream, which had an impressive flow. Refreshing to hear the sound of substantial natural water.
- Feeling quite exhausted pumper and I decided to call it after almost 3 miles at around 7pm.

- Packed up and headed to Callahan’s for lunch before hopping on trail
- cool lodge. Ran into some familiar faces there. Started talking to someone else and they joined pumper, dick and I. Dirt had caught up and she and another hiker joined too.
- Got the steelhead salmon over mushroom risotto. Mmmmm. They also give you your first beer free, which I made an Ashland amber.
- Finished up and headed to the trailhead. Felt good to get walking again.
- For as flat as Oregon is we sure started with some consistent elevation gain
- A lot hotter and drier compared to when we got off the other day. Much hotter.
- Got to a ridge and there is shasta still staring at us. So ready not to see shasta anymore!
- Also a great view of Mount mccloughlin to the north, which the trail passes by
- Continued along the ridge to a spring, where we filled up and planned a campsite to aim for
- Campsites becoming increasingly rare along the trail outside of campgrounds as the ground becomes rocky
- twisted Juniper trees begin to line the trail and the strong scent of incense cedar fills the air
- Reached the spot we planned to camp, a dirt road, and realized it led 3 miles directly to a resivior the trail passes in 4.5 trail miles
- Decided to just walk that and camp at some sites listed there
- Cool road walk with some massive cabins and houses lining the gravel road
- Made it to the campsite. Such nice soft ground under big pines. Can hear the water pouring over the spillway of the resivior. Great spot.
- Ate some snacks dinner since I was still rather full from the risotto.

- Tent weighed at least 3x normal from the water weight
- real cold, so got moving quickly to warm up

- Began a climb up into the Siskiyou mountains, geologically distinct from
- The cascades as it’s all uplift and not volcanic
- Continued through some big wildflower fields and arrived a chair and two empty coolers
- After a few minutes of waiting Pumper’s godfather, Dick, pulled up on the dirt road next to the trail. He maintains this soda stash. We helped him restock it, and then the crew we camped with slowly started to arrive
- We Hung out for a while, and then began the drive down to Medford where we will be staying with dick for a day
- has been joking about endless breadsticks at Olive Garden while on trail, and decided to actually do it for lunch
- Amazing, so full
- Got to the house and dried out the gear, had some beers, then grilled some patties for dinner. Real nice.

- Packed up camp and got started up to complete the road walk to the saddle. Decent amount of logging. Cool waterfall.
- Reached the saddle and hopped back on the trail. Started walking up into the cloud base.
- Some great views of clouds moving over the ridges
- Dew on all of foliage up here, amazing how the light hits and refracts off it
- Took another little logging road for a few miles. More consistent grade up a climb, and get to see stuff just outside the bubble of the trail
- Break for lunch. Pumper and turtle caught up. Surprisingly cold up here!
- Got moving again, really cool ridge walk. Clouds mostly burnt off by now.
- Went through a nice big meadow and saw a cabin mentioned on the map. Walked up to it and took a little break inside. CABIN HISTORY.
- After a little break Decided to do the last mile to the state line
- the sign and logbook came into view and turtle was hanging out
- Stopped to sign the register and take a photo. Pretty wild to have walked the entire length of California and reflect on the time
- After a few minutes got going again only to run into trail magic after a few hundred yards
- “come on up and wash your hands of California.” I did and then grabbed a drink. We then did a little ceremony of sitting in a chair carved into a tree stump and doing a shot of tequila while getting our photo taken. Fun!
- Sat and snacked for an hour. G-spice, snake charmer, and uncle buck all arrived
- We all Decided to hike another 4 miles into Oregon to setup camp near a spring
- Got going to finish the climb. Awesome ridge walk while the sun began to set.
- Got to the spring and filled up on water and set up camp. Great views, but became clear there was going to be a lot of condensation, and my stuff was still a bit damp from last night
- As I was falling asleep heard a crazy sound, like a high pitched scream. Snake charmer identified it as a mountain lion. Sounded like it was next to my head!

- slept in until 8
- A few lines of storms moved through each night, a few with substantial wind. Really glad to not be out there.
- Forecast is for more intense storms today, so we decide to make the brief walk to breakfast in town to see how it builds
- No monument etc
- Really good breakfast. Pancakes, eggs, bacon, and a huge milkshake.
- As breakfast turns to lunch we walk another half mile to the Wildwood.
- Ordered a few beers and play a couple rounds of pool. Very mellow afternoon.
- The place is quickly full of hikers. The weather doesn’t seem to be improving, but it’s also not worsening… a group of us begins to discuss heading out.
- Of course, by this point everyone is hungry again, so we begin ordering more food and drinks.
- By now it’s 6pm, and our table decided to get moving
- The climb out is super steep, and there are rumors of poor maintence.
- We Decided to do a road walk, the majority on a forest road, which is much more kindly graded and cuts 3 miles off. I have no remorse for doing this considering how many miles we’ve walked away from Canada the past week.
- With six of us, and food and drinks in our system, the mood is very jovial
- Four miles into the walk I realize I left my electronics bag and battery at the restersunt! No headphones, no charger… shit!! Will probably repurchase in Ashland and call to see if they can ship that stuff home. First big gear goof on trail.
- Spot a nice level dirt area off the road and decide to go for it
- A little annoyed about forgetting the electronics, but glad to have made a small dent today with the weather being a variable.

Aug 9

- Got going at 5:15. The rain held off overnight but the sky was quite covered with high stratus
- Really interesting trail this morning. Some lakes and exposed rock, trail winding up into trees. Cross a saddle to an amazing view of a big lake below. Feels great out here.
- Some light Virga is actually falling up here at 7k feet, but continues to mostly hold out
- Continued along across a few nice ridges with good views while watching the clouds begin to develop
- Took a break for lunch next to a lake around 1pm. By now it felt as though the temperature had actually dropped a bit. We talked about the possibility of hiking the entire way into Seiad Valley, another 26 miles on top of the 17 or so we had already done. It might be possible because the last 20 of those miles are downhill, although there were rumors of lots of bushwhacking and blow downs (down trees)
- We started off again and some substantial clouds had developed during our break
- Over the next 20 minutes it rapidly built and we began to hear frequent thunder, sometimes catching a glimpse of lighting hitting the ridge across the valley
- After two 500 foot climbs we were now on top of the opposing ridge, and wanting to get down quickly incase things worsened above us
- it became clear we had threaded the needle with this line as we continued across the last few miles of ridge
- The downhill began, and there were a few meadows which by this point in the season were mostly brown—a stark difference from those of the Sierra.
- After a few hundred feet and some single lane trail running along old forest roads the brush began to get pretty overgrown, but not unbearable
- At this point I had been walking alone, and as the downhill continued and my excitement about doing a 40+ day into town built I began to jog and run small sections where gravity was assisting
- Most of the blown downs had recently been resolved by trail maintenance crews, hugely appreciated work
- The descent takes you across NAME creek several times, and there were a few nice bridges
- Eventually the brush let up a bit, and the trail began to level out.
- It started to raid a bit, a heavy drizzle at worst, which was refeshing as the temperature had certainly risen over the descent
- Reached the campground at the trailhead marking the end of the descent. The last five miles were all road walks into town.
- The road began as gravel, and about halfway through joins with a paved road which takes you along the Klamath River. Town is right across the river, but the road takes you quite far out of the way to cross over a bridge.
- Just as I hit the highway it began to rain hard, and lightning began overhead. There were only a few hundred yards to a private campground where a resident of Seiad let’s PCT hikers camp on his property for free
- I ducked under a collapsible tent to get out of the rain and sat there for a bit
- Morgan, the owner came out of a small structure and saw me. “How long have you been there?” It had been maybe 20 minutes
- He offered to let me stay in a cabin on the property since the weather was so poor. Amazing!
- Just as he began to show me the way pumper came walking down the road! Wasn’t sure if he’d make the push all the way to town. Awesome.
- He shows us both to the cabin, really cool.
- Leaves us only to return 15 minutes later with Turtle, a hiker who paced with pumper and I for a few miles going into Etna. So good.
- We get set up and are glad to be out of the rain. Really lucked out with the generosity.

- Ate a pint of ice cream then packed the resupply.
- Headed back over to Denny with a small group. Ordered lunch, a beer and a pizza with smoked steelhead salmon, pesto, feta, and tomatoes. Ate a few pieces but packed out most of it for dinner later.
- Had one more beer then closed out and headed to the road to hitch.
- Lots of cars drove by, then one picked us up

- He got burnt out and dropped everything to disconnect and move here. Consulted a monk who told him to watch nothing, listen to nothing, read nothing for a month. Just sit and stare at the wall. He did that for two months to the surprise of the monk.
- Got to the trailhead and started the climb out and into the Marble Mountains. The burn area continued into here quite deeply, making the ridge walk very exposed. incredibly beautiful.
- Appeared to be some smoke in the valley from the fires up north in Oregon. Hoping it holds out and there aren’t any closures.
- Clouds began to form, the temperature notably dropped, and the winds picked up as the day continued. It’s forecasted to thunderstorm over the next two days. A 30 percent chance. We’ll see…
- Got to camp and ate most of the leftover pizza. Also tried an experimental desert made of crushed Oreos and chips ahoy congealed into one big zip locked mess by a full tub of chocolate fudge icing. Pretty insane. So many calories!
- Went to bed hoping to awake to mellow weather.

Aug 7

- woke up at 5:15 and started the initial climb.
- Really nice ridge walk with big views. Always easier to do when you can sense yourself getting somewhere, even if I was walking south west and away from Canada
- entered the Russian wilderness, with craggy peaks and some big smooth granite faces
- Big burn areas in here too. Trees like tooth picks. The extent of the damage is broad in how long it lasts through time.
- At moments could see where the trail ran up to 5 miles away. Made for a nice sense of accomplishment when reaching a point seen earlier.
- Lots of up and down here. A few 1000ft+ climbs
- reached the peak of the last climb overlooking LAKE NAME. Great view of the valley. The last stretch.
- Got to the trailhead and sat by the road to begin hitching. A few cars zipped by. Was super hot and no shade so a little cranky.
- A big white SUV pulled in and a woman gestured to hop in. Super nice. Had hiked some sections of the pct and JMT. 18 mile drive and a big descent, would be a hellish road walk.
- Went to Denny Brewing Co to get lunch. This spot feels out of place in how nice it is. Then fungi burger and the Ashland pale ale. Very good. Ended up grabbing another beer with pumper, then a few other familiar faces joined us at the bar. Next thing you know I’m four or five nikka highballs deep and pumper the same on manhattans.
- Ordered the lobster tail macaroni and cheese for dinner. An older couple sat next to us, and we eventually began having a good conversation about the trail, education, and the role of phones in our lives.
- When closing out it turned out they had bought pumper and I our dinner! Amazing.
- Had a really good time.
- Left At around 10 to head to the public park to camp. The city lets backpackers camp there for $5, and provides a number of hiker amenities.
- Fell asleep rather quickly—great day.

- woke up to a cloudy sky, the first time there has been any significant cloud cover overhead since Agua Dulce! Insane.
- The cooler temp felt great. Stopped by a spring to get some water and was on my way.
- Heard a group of cows on trail thanks to their cowbells. As I approached I blew my emergency whistle and a small stampede headed off, except for one hardened heffer who stayed put and side-eyed me as I passed.
- Really cool section through red volcanic rock. Mostly downhill to highway 3. Went by super fast, around 12 miles by 9:30. Ran into a SOBO girl who did not sleep that much due to a mountain lion pacing around her campsite most of the night. Took a break for pumper to catch up and talk about the rest of the day.
- Entered the trinity alps wilderness.
- After another 6 miles did lunch at a nice stream. Ended up napping for a few minutes. Somehow the cap to my hand sanitized unscrewed in my fanny pack and sanitized everything in it. Oof.
- Got moving again after some effort. Some decent uphill here. Smooth trail thru big boulder fields. Some very nice meadows and lakes. Sort of like a small taste of the Sierra again. Glad to be going thru it but frustrating to be tracking so far southwest still!
- Talked to an older woman who had hiked 1200 miles of it back in 77! Amazing. Ran into a ton of snow. shout-out barb.
- Decided to push to Carter meadows summit, aka where the trail meets forest highway 903.
- Was feeling pretty fatigued towards the end of the day. The sun felt more intense than it has recently. Has begun to feel more like an excessive in endurance recently. Still very much enjoying it and learning a lot, but certain points in the day now are difficult in a diff mental way.

- Hang our for a moment and decide to push for campsites 12 miles away
- Trail is nice and flat but annoyingly goes almost in a full loop to avoid a big canyon, ugh
- Make it to the campsite and hear sounds in the distance, realize it’s cowbells!
- Grab some water from the spring nearby and setup camp.
- Talk to the only other person apart from pumper on the ridge, an older guy finishing up this section of the trail he missed in 1979

- Hung around and generally lazy for a while, packed my bag and got organized

- Called lily real quick to check in before heading out on trail
- Drove to the trailhead. Was really cool standing there with barry and dick who did it together so long ago. Pretty profound moment.
- Said our thanks and goodbyes, then started up the trail towards castle crags.
- New shoes and sock system feel totally amazing. Such a massive difference in each step.
- For sure had too much caffeine as I’m feeling a big crash, which is a little rough in the heat
- We accidentally take the wrong trail at a junction and hike 600ft in a mile, whoops. Realized and had to turn around. Fortunately the walk of shame was down and not up.
- Got back on trail and continued for a few miles, then had to take a break near a stream to give myself a few moments to feel better from this crash and heavy digestion of all the food
- Got going and how the big climb began up past the crags
- Really warm in the sun, and was surprised by how little sun coverage there was. Quite the grade in spots too.
- As the sun began making its way down the crabs began lighting up in gold
- Filled up at the last water for the next 10 miles, then continued to locate a campsite on the ridge up ahead
- The air began cooling off, feeling great now that the crash fully passed
- Total climb of 4800ft
- Located some great spots at the top of the climb, made camp, and put a big dent in those several slices of pizza. Mmmmm.
- Feeling very refreshed after such a good day together with pumper, barry and dick. Such a good crew.

- We head to the hotel and freshen up
- Hang outside and have a few drinks
- Go to The Blue Room, a thai restersunt. Really good fish curry.

- up at 4:30 and on trail before the sun was up
- Began with a climb. Super lush and very dense trees
- As the sun came up the temperature remained constant as elevation was gained
- By 10 I had done 15 miles
- Stopped for a quick break to snack and fill up on water from a stream off trail. Found a spot with a great view of Shasta, which at this point is absolutely gargantuan
- ran into a trail maintenxe crew clearing overgrowth from the trail, talked for a while
- After the section they had cleared the brush became quite dense, a lot of bush wacking
- Around 11:30 it began to heat up quite substantially with the sun directly overhead and very little coverage
- Finished the total of 3100ft ascent
- Made it to the next water source 6 miles away and couldn’t help but stop for another brief break
- After 20 miles my feet are killing me as my shoes have zero support and the insoles are basically non-existent.
- Get going and begin the good 1300ft climb up to ridge, really feeling it in the feet at this point
- The ridge goes up and down continuously over the next 12 miles
- We stop to get water and are very tired by this point even though it’s only 6:30pm. While filling up we decide to just camp here instead of pushing the additional 3 miles and 500ft of ascent to an area where we are unsure of the campsites right before a big descent.
- Good day, really looking forward to these new shoes arriving in two days

- Got a little stuck simply hanging around petting the dog and drinking soda.
- Bought Some new shoes and socks from REI which Pumper’s father is going to pick up in Reno and deliver when he meets us in Dunsmuir Saturday afternoon. Can’t wait as the current shoes are destroyed.
- Finally headed out at noon.
- The miles passed quickly, and before we knew it we were at Burney Falls
- Stopped by the general store. split a six pack and I got two large soft serve twists. Mmmm.

- Walked 6 miles to a creek, got some water, then continued .3 to a campsite

July 30

- the alarm went off at 4:30 and I began to break down camp
- Started a brief road walk down the highway to where the trail intersects, barely enough light to see as the day before the new moon
- Hopped on trail and started a brief climb up to Hat Creek Rim, which we’d follow for much of the day
- Was super cold, kept my jacket on and zipped up this entire time
- Reached an observation area at the top and got a good view of Mount Lassen behind us, and the snow covered peak of Mount Shasta ahead
- Began following the trail as it hugged the edge of the rim, incredible watching then sun ride from up here
- After several days of walking in densely wooded forest I can eagerly say I prefer the expansiveness of these drier open spaces. Altho often bitter and more exposed, I greatly enjoy the slow motion parallax effect perceived throughout the day while traversing 30 miles in a straight line. There is also something distinctly planetary feeling about seeing such a wide area move past you at the speed of a walk.
- by 10am the sun was high enough to begin really warming things up. Tried to recall how cold I was this morning!
- Stopped for lunch and some much needed water after around 18 miles at cache 22, which is maintained by a volunteer and funded by donations. Without this the water carry would be extremely heavy, just like being back in the desert.
- Had lunch with a small group gathered in the shade nearby. An older couple discussed wanting a new cooking solution, and I haven’t used my stove and cook kit once since leaving the Sierra. I sold it to them on the spot! Now don’t need to package and ship it home.
- Got going again around 11:45 and the sun was at full blast
- Began descending onto a lava field. Huge boulders of solidified lava as dark as night. Their irregular shapes made them very uncomfortable to walk on, and with several hundred miles on my shoes there is very little cushion left
- Passed mile 1400!
- After walking on the volcanic rock for a few miles I noticed through the brush a freshly paved road. I checked the map and it paralleled the trail for a few miles. No brained to give the feet a rest and walk that for a bit!
- After reaching the point where the road intersected the trail I noticed a dirt road on the map which led to high voltage power lines. Those appeared to lead directly back to the trail right where I needed to be, as opposed to walking the paved road I was on north and adding unnecessary miles to get back on trail.
- Decided to give it a shot, and sure enough there was a dirt road under the power lines!
- Walked that until the road terminated at a scramble down next to a hydroelectric plant. I knew the trail was somewhere near here, but unsure where, so I pulled up my position on the map. The trail was only 100 yards away directly below me. Amazing!
- Found The trail and rested at a nice cold creek for around 30 minutes, the pumper showed up and we continued to rest for another 30
- Our plan was to hitch into the town of Burney to resupply for a 3.5 day push to Dunsmuir, but now we began discussing simply stopped at the Burney Mountain Guest Ranch to rest and do a modest resupply.
- Finally got going to do the next 2.5 miles into the ranch
- Arrived and got two beds in the bunk house, of which we were the only guests! Much cheaper than a private room and effectively the same.
- Had dinner and caught up with two other hikers staying the night
- Washed up and caught up with friends and family by the pool
- Got to sleep by around 9:30

- Awesome log paths across the meadows!
- Reached fhe rdge of The burn area (fire history)
- Super exposes and very hot as I descend. One sizsble water cary
- Reached the end of Lassen and was a little sad, even though it was such a brief section, I had been rederencing it in the map the last week
- Now that I’m past halfway began thinking about the end of the trail. Imagining buying the plane ticket home after reaching Canada, etc
- Because of the big breakfast in the late morning I did not stop for lunch, and had forgotten to easily Stowe some snacks
- Mistake as I began to get very groggy and hungry by 4pm
- Pumper caught up within the last 4 miles as we aimed to resupply in old station for a day
- Made it to the road and tried hitching for a few minutes with no luck, so did the 3 mile road walk
- The restersunt rumored to be opened until 8nhad closed at 5, so we went to the gas station next door
- Feet and lets super tired. Very little up, mostly level or slightly down. Great for cruising, but you only really activate one muscle group for the entire day, really wearing them out 
- Tomorrrow will be a big push into Bernie. Over 30 miles through a super dry and exposed section. The hope is to knock most of the rough stuff out early in the day.

- The rave ran all night, and when waking up I’d remove an earplug to check if I could still hear it. The sound carried down the canyon as we began the day.
- The day began immediately with a big climb from 3k feet to just above 7k over 12 miles. Fortunately the trail ran up the side of the canyon within shadow, and once the sun began to break through we entered into dense trees
- Lots of water in the way up, which is nice as water caries become longer again
- Took a brief break halfway thru the climb to clean off the feet. Trail has been super dusty recently making this nrssecsreh again

- Some nice meadows

- Got a drink and a burger and waited for pumper to arrive
- Talking to some attendees and they all seem to know at least a little about how the trail literally spits you out right here
- Looked at the artist roster and some people I know from LA are performing
- The other side of the canyon we were to climb goes up for about 3k and is directly in the sunlight all day. It was going to be hot, so the plan became to wait out the heat, but it Starts to become a question how hard it will be to leave this…
- Recognize some people from LA and say hi, they give me an entire half bottle of rosè.
- Dancing and hanging to a friends set by the river and drinking
- End up talking to a reporter for the guardian about the intersection of the trail and this river rave, interesting convo
- ate a little bit more and debated with other hikers about our plan to escape
- Decided to go to the main stage, dance, and polish off a PBR. Altho we were told we could hang security gave us a hard time about being at a stage, so we decided to simply finish the beers and start hiking up the huge ridge climb in front of us after walking over w confusing bridge under construction.

- Not much traffic. A lady pulls up and hops out—she goes inside and I decide to get more ice cream. Start talking to the owner about the trail and she overheard. “Where to next?” “Well, short term trying to get to the lakeside resteraubt to get some good food!” She says, “oh, well I can give you a ride” yes!
- We Hop in. Her husband is in the car and had wanted to do the PCT or JMT for some time.
- Great convo. She helps relocate people who have lost there homes in fires.
- We get to the restersunt and order food and a drink. Fish and chips and an Elysian star dust for me.
- So good but hard for both of us to even make a dent in our food. So used to eating small portions but so hungry.
- End up staying way longer than intended. After four drinks and as many hours we head outside. Someone asks if we’re hiking and we say yep, but no ride.
- We stand on the side of the road for maybe 20nseconss and a car begins leaving the parking lot.

- Some snow walking!
- Took lunch at 11:30am at the east branch of bear trap creek. Washed the feet off and relaxed for probably 45min. Had done 14 miles.
- Next was a series of three decent climbs followed by descents. These went by fairly quickly as we had a rocket pace after lunch.
- really cool ridge on the second climb, panoramic view
- After the climbs was a lot of down!  My right knee has been giving me issues in the down for the past few days, and it began to noticeably flair up today
- Stopped by alder spring to get some water. Somehow ended up hanging here in the cool shade next to the water for an hour after deciding to do only another 6 to hit 34 miles instead of doing 12 to hit 40. Felt great to just reign it in a bit, and probably smart to avoid injury by overdoing it in terrain which was still somewhat demanding
- 2000km
- Came up to someone who was laying down and leaning on their pack in an odd place. Pumper asked if they were ok, to which they said “dying in a bed of wildflowers wouldn’t be the worst I suppose!”
- I asked if they had water, and he said “that’s actually the issue… I’m almost down to nothing”
- This didn’t seem as urgent as the situation coming out of walker pass, although it was certainly similar
- Gave him plenty of water, and since he was headdd south bound informed him of the water a few miles ahead at alder.
- Continued on, but found the campsites we had been looking at to be occupied. Water was also indeed scarce, so we pushed to a creek a few hundred feet off trail next to a fire road with some improvised campsites.
- Set up camp and had dinner at around 8:00
- Another big day. Tomorrow will be somewhat mellower as we plan to stop by Buck Lake instead of hitching into Quincy.

- I was feeling quite bad during this climb, likely the buritto. A headache was also slowly increasing in intensity. Looking doen to spot my steps I’d get a bit dizzy. The motion and saccades of my eyes scanning felt like too much visual stimulation
- Passed mile 1200!
- Stopped for a lunch break near the top for around 20 minutes
- Reached the top of the climb and began descending into the valley below
- There are several lakes in the area, and I had heard good things about the Packer Lake Lodge restaurant nearby, so we stopped in around 3:30
- Ordered a linguini bolegnesse and glass of red. So good. Immediately started to feel better.
- Hung out on the porch eating and drinking with pumper and two other hikers. Visitors would walk by and ask “PCT?” Fun conversations.
- Ordered another glass of wine, feeling much better
- Planned to do the next climb out of the valley and camp near the top of the ridge
- Got back on the trail and felt so much better. Was flying up the climb.
- This section is a new re-route first introduced last year. You can feel it is different from the rest of the the trail in the area up till now. Some big up with no switchbacks, which I kind of like.
- Sun began nearing the horizon and big storm clouds way out in the distance began lighting up
- The light was passing thru the trees covered in moss at the top in a remarkable way
- Found two good camp sites with a nice view and decided to camp there
- Made camp and ate a little to wind down.
- Really good day apart from feeling a little jank on that first big climb.

- was hard getting to sleep last night as a few hikers stayed up late bantering beneath the sleeping loft
- Woke up at 5:30 and let the alarm ring a little longer than needed just to return the favor
- Pumper and I packed up and were out at 6. Our plan was to push 34 miles to Sierra City
- Some snow and small stream crossings to start the day. Plenty of mud.
- The morning continued with some climbs between ridges with patchy snow
- It was nice to pace with pumper after so many days did going solo. We talked for a while about his father, an aerospace engineer for Lockheed, and his affinity for sailplanes and gliding. Pumper solo’d At 14, and his father is one of the few pilots with over 200 diamond cross country flights logged. Gets me excited to get flying again!
- we had done 12 miles by 10am, and by noon had done 16 and completed all the big climbs for the day, leaving us with a mostly uninterrupted cruise the rest of the way into town
- to celebrate we took a brief break for lunch at the top of the last climb
- After around 20 minutes we began the remaining 18 miles into town
- Altho mostly downhill, there were a few 250 and 500 foot climbs, which truthfully was a nice break from the continuous downhill
- Around 5 miles out of town I began to get serious tunnel vision. We had done 30 miles in 9.5 hours, a redic pace. Kind of like watching the credits of a movie in a theatre, and afterwards everything appears to be moving in the opposite direction
- Finally Made it to the junction to cut into a camp ground, saving us 2 miles of road walking
- Got a nice hitch for the last mile into town
- We felt rather defeated as the general store, the only place opened on Monday, was to have closed 15 minutes before
- Fortunately for us the store was still open, so we split a six pack and half gallon of ice cream. Mmmm.
- Sat in the porch and talked someone visiting about their hike in 2017 where they attempted to ski the Sierra in May! Insane.
- A few of the stores have gotten together to setup a free area for thru-hikers to camp. The church next door had two public restrooms they maintain, which is very kind
- Set up and then three locals pull up in a car trying to party. Total white trash. I dip out into my tent. It’s been a long day and I’m just not up for it. oh well. Great cruising with pumper today, and hope to for a few days to come.
- No more snow after Sierra city is the rumor

- Had a great nights sleep, apart from the trains running thru the ass, but they didn’t pose an annoyance—the sound was so intense it was sort of awe inspiring to hear it go over the pass
- Went downstairs for breakfast at 8, blueberry pancakes, oatmeal, bacon, coffee, and orange juice. So good.
- Did a few chores, packed up and was out at 11
- Super easy hitch back to the Donner ski lodge
- Ran into pumper from the Sierra, good to catch up. Trying to convince him to do an easy 8 to the Peter Grubb Ski Lodge, where I was planning to crash
- Two free beers, chicken sandwich
- Had to take a little nap to let things digest
- Out At 3
- Did a quick 8 to then Peter Grubb ski hut
- Pumper was there! Decided to hang.
- Hangs and quick dinner, then went up to the sleeping loft

- woke up at 5:30 and was on trail by 6 to begin the climb up to the ridge
- Entered Granite Chief Wilderness
- Incredible views from up here, and the ridge is comprised of incredible volcanic stuff
- Really love ridge walks
- Great views of Tahoe
- Passed through a ski area with lifts and boundary warning signs
- A mellow descent led to a junction where I met a small group of day hikers who gave me grapes and an apple!
- Began a 1500ft climb up to a peak with more ski lifts
- Crossed the ridge and there was a decent amount of snow. Saw a lot
- Of boot track and began descending. This turned into boot track in mud down quite a scramble. After around 15 minutes I realized something was not quite right, as this was taking me rather far in the wrong direction.
- To conserve battery my phone was off, so I turned it on to check the map and my position. Sure enough, way off trail and considerably lower than where I needed to be
- So began the long scramble back up, which took around 30 minutes
- This took a lot out of me, mentally and physically. Particularly frustrating as after his brief descent started another climb with a steep grade
- Began the climb up to Tinker Knob. Super dense in wildflowers (elephant ears?)
- The last mile climbed 1000ft. Upon reaching the top I could see Truckee to the east and I-80, along with several remarkable volcanic faces in the distance
- With this being the last big climb I was eager to begin descending into Donner pass (some history here)
- The distance a mile represents seems to increase exponentially the closer to town you get
- Stood at the side of the road for 5 seconds and got a quick 1.5 mile hitch to the lodge
- Checked in and there was only one other person staying in the Men’s dorm, a hiker who I met at around mile 450! Amazing.
- Had a great family style dinner at 6 after having freshened up and started my load of laundry. Incredible how much dirt can accumulate in only two days
- Chores
- Crashed the kitchen after dinner where the staff gave us some leftovers, wine and cookies. Nice.
- Got to bed by 10pm. Always feels good to sleep in a real bed.

- got going around 7. Incredible sunrise with the light hitting the snow covered peaks across lake aloha
- Today will need to be a big day to make it to Clair Tappaan by tomorrow in the early evening for the family style dinner
- trail followed lake aloha, then began down past several lakes toward susie lake
- The trail then began a big 1800ft climb approaching Dicks Pass
- Patchy snow down the steep grade made for tricky navigation
- The trail continued to meander around lakes with super blue water
- exited the desolation wilderness
- took a lunch break and realized my external battery did not actually charge in Tahoe, leaving me with no way of charging my phone now at 10%. needed to stretch this two days for navigation as my maps are on there
- The trail began to climb up 1500ft towards
- Granite Chief Wilderness
- By now it was 6pm, and ahead of me was a ridge lasting several miles with mostly exposed campsites
- although it was early, i decided to camp here at a site with good coverage instead of a site on the ridge with a good view. Prioritizing good sleep for the continued push tomorrow
- Could barely keep my eyes open while eating dinner

- woke up at 8 and headed to breakfast at Bert’s CafeZ highly recommended.
- Picked up some remaining food items for resupply
- Went back to the hotel and packed the bag. Probably have upwards of a week of food on me. Whoops.
- Checked out and stopped by a sporting good store. No toe socks but I did find a super light pair of boys sandals that weigh nothing and had no price tag or equivalent box. They gave them to me for $5. Cut the back strap off and we’re in serious action.
- Saw a Lime scooter parked! How funny would it be to take this to the trail instead of hitching.
- Drove it 45 minutes to within a mile of the trailhead where the bike lane stopped only to be unable to lock it due to bad cell service! Ended up needing to ride it back basically all the way to finally lock.
- Hitched At a stop sign at a 4-way intersection. A girl pulled over on her way home from work. “Where to? You’re not gonna kill me, right?” Hah!
- Super nice, dropped me off at the echo chalet.
- Talked to a few hikers doing the Tahoe Rim Trail while eating a pint of ice cream. a ranger warned me about an increase in bear activity.
- Hiked around 6 miles in. Lots of people. Annoying loose rocks. Some snow. Found an amazing site on the shoreline of Lake Aloha.
- After making camp walked down to the water and found the perect place to recline and watch the sun slowly drift towards the horizon.

- woke up at 5:30 and left by 6 to knock out 14 miles into town
- Beautiful morning, nice meadows. So many wildflowers!!
- Decent climb and surprised by how much patchy snow heading down into town
- Made it to the parking lot for Echo Mountain trailhead. Another hiker was there trying to hitch at the highway . He had a beard and looked a little “woodsy”. Had maybe 50 cars drive by, mostly Subaru’s, and none stopped.
- Called someone listed as a volunteer for giving rides and left a message. He called back a few minutes later and offered to drive 20 minutes to give us the 20 minute ride into town.
- Went back into the parking lot to wait, and maybe a minute later a white van pulls up. “You need a ride?” Amazing. Called and said never mind to the original offer. He opened the trunk of the van and there was an assortment of doughnuts and hot coffee! Damn!
- Made it into town and checked into my hotel room at 11am
- Got lunch, a burrito salad w/ mahi-mahi, shitty indie cover that 500 miles song everyone was quoting in Instagram captions at mile 500
- Stopped by Kmart to resupply and within 5 minutes heard as many domestic disputes
- going into town my shoes were wet, and not wanting to walk around town in wet shoes I Bought sandals that turned out way too small, whoops. Maybe I’m just not supposed to have camp shoes.
- Got back to the hotel and watched trashy tv.
- started planning for the next stretch to soda springs, 100 miles ahead.
- Between here and there is a spot Called Claire Tappaan, a lodge owned by the Sierra club, which I’m a member of.
- Lily’s family has been involved with the Sierra Club going back generations. her mother’s father was a photographer who would go climbing out in the Sierra back in the 40s (check). This is an important stop for me and one I’ve been looking forward to.
- It’s only 33 miles ahead. Will be leaving tahoe tomorrow afternoon and aim to get at least 10 miles in. This will give me a solid day to meander through the Desilation Wilderness, another highlight of the trail, as I only need to get to Clair Tappaan by 6pm for dinner on Saturday.

He came to America from sweeden as an exchange student when he was 18 and stayed with a family who was part of the Sierra club. They would go bag a peak in the Sierra every weekend. 40 years after doing Whitney he’s back out here doing the PCT.

- woke up at 6am and hit the creek crossingZ had gone down a solid 6–8”
- Was freezing the next few miles
- Was nice to get some time in before the misquitos hit
- The sun finally start to hit the trail and I stopped to eat some breakfast and get some water
- By the time I left the misquitos we’re out in full force
- 9 mile climb out to Dorothy Lake Pass, is gradual you don’t really notice the climb
- tons of mud and Eventually hit patchy snow, making it a little tricky to navigate
- Big meadow, super swampy, sticky steps
- Eventually the snow became more or less continuous, and you reach Dorothy Lake
- It’s incredibly beautiful up here. I look down and light is reflecting off a jet black obsidian stone. I’m dumbfounded. Right here in the middle of all this glacial till 
- I continue walking and realize this is it. This is the border of Yosemite. The end of the “high” Sierra. The Sierra you picture when you think of Sierra. It’s a heavy moment. You have this on he horizon for so long, and now it’s over.
- Behind me are young jagged peaks, and a head of me are old rounded mountains. A transition point. I feel as though I’m standing at the same position in the landscape as I find myself in the timeline of life. The feeling is overwhelming.
- I continue walking through patchy snow, crossing a few streams of cold melting snow about knee deep.
- I run into cous cous, a new face, and we talked on this for a while. After some brief hesitation to check, we both deduce we must be only hundreds of yards away from crossing 1000 miles, and confirm we indeed are.
- I begin walking, and after only a few minutes round a corner like any other and see an arrangement of stones in the ground. “1000”
- Apart from the arrangement to mark the occasion this feels just like any other discreet part of trail; true of past numerical monuments, and I suspect of future.
- Now is the climb up into the older and rounder mountains bordering the protected Hoover Wilderness. the map indicates a ridge walk almost continuously at 10.5k
- Passing through treeline happens quickly, and now I can see an expanse of snowy switchbacks in a huge bowl, and an exposed back made of loose till.
- I do not feel up for slogging in slushy snow late in the day at a high grade, so shooting straight up the side to the ridge is the choice
- For each step you take one back, but eventually the steps coalesce into something narrow and compacted
- The climb is extremely fun, excillerating even, as I watch the snow covered switchbacks fade behind me as I dart up and in between higher patches of snow
- Reaching the ridge I’m awestruck by the expansive view of all the high Sierra behind me. All of the distance and time covered through this past section
- The ridge continues. Imagine a level plane interrupted by massive uplift and tilted to the edge of the angle of repose, the sheer edge of falling off, seemingly forever
- I walk this for a few miles before running into cous cous and a few familiar faces. He’s found himself a nest inside a ticket of high altitude shrubs clinging to the mountain side. Crucial cover for sleeping as the wind is already ripping past at high sustained speeds.
- I see two people walking southbound and say hello. I ask if they flipped and they say no, they had done the JMT last year and are out for the weekend, their first time since then. The one comments on how the climb up from Sonora pass was a snow slog, and cannot imagine the entire trail through the Sierra this year.
- I ask if they had seen any better area for campsites, and they said no, deciding for me this area will be it.
- They continued on their way only to return a few minutes later. “Here, I thought you could use this,” he said, holding two tabs of acid.
- I’ve only had one *real* phsycadellic experience maybe 3 years ago, and had found it a profound experience offering all sorts of small epiphanies. Earlier in the day, provided everything previously mentioned, I had found myself wanting for the first time since then to truly have another of those experiences. Amazingly, it just shows up. I give one tab to those at camp who would like to share, and hang on to one for myself.
- Before making camp I scrambled up the ridge to see if there were any promising sites. The last grouping of brush protected a small crater made of loose rock, excellent coverage and the view from up here was unparalleled in every direction. Camp it is!
- I return to eat dinner with the others. Considering tomorrow is a resupply day I make two dinners to celebrate the momentous day. As I put the water on to boil, maybe an hour before sunset, I do half a tab.
- Dinner is great, and the antics are good. I gather my things and head to my spot to make camp, an easy task as tonight I’ll cowboy camp.
- I realize that, amazingly up here, I have full cell service, adding an entirely other dimension to this feeling of connectedness today.
- The setting sun illuminated the entire Sierra behind me in gold light. I walk a little distance to a rock outcropping providing some wind coverage and an amazing view. I lean into it in a way that interfaces with my body so perfectly I don’t feel any points of contact
- as the sun begins to set I decide to do the second half tab, and slowly the earths shadow begins moving up the sky, a nearly full moon begins reflecting off the snow
- I’m positioned at an angle to where the massively uplifted plane appears as the level horizon, and the Sierra and gradient sky seem to be falling off at an angle. A total perspective shift.
- I stay there for the entire sunset, and when it is dark begin walking back to my spot.
- I get in my quilt and instantly feel warm and prop myself up to have a view of the ridgeline peak ahead of me and the stars
- I’m not looking up, but out at the expanse as satellites fly over, and beneath that commercial airliners
- It becomes clear sleep will not happen, but I’m ok with it. Nights like this are important.

- throughout the night I’d wake up and look at the snow and stars as the moon tracked its across the sky.
- Alarm went off at 5:30, but I didn’t fully wake up for another hour as I watched the canyon walls become illuminated by the sunrise
- Started the descent and was glad I waited until this morning when I was fresh. A decent amount of snow and navigation required. The campsites also has nothing on last night.
- The trail briefly went up into snow, and I wanted nothing to do with that, so I looked at the topo and worked my way around it. Glad I did as it only took a few minutes instead of route finding to stay on trail.
- crosses Piute creek, which is more of a swamp with a bunch of logs then a creek. Could’ve simply gotten my feet a little wet, but the hopping between fallen logs at perpendicular angles almost became a game.
- Lots of misquitos. There were many yesterday, too, but this is another level.
- Large climb up to Seavey Pass, with some beautiful lakes at the top.
- The descent was surprisingly snowy. The trail follows the Kerrick Creek through here along a steep canyon wall. Some of the snowy sections were quite steep and a slip would send you into the raging river below.
- Tried boulder scrambling some of those sections to varying degrees of success, and returned to trail once it began drying up.
- Had lunch at a nice dry area with a particularly ergonomic depression
- You then cross Kerrick Creek, which at the trail is nightmare material. Fortunately there was a log around 100 yards upstream which requires a nice little jump at the end to make it back to land
- next was another climb to an unmade ridge, but involved a good 1000ft of ascent/descent. The pct through here loved to do this, cutting straight across ridges instead of following valleys.
- another creek crossing in Stubblefield Canyon. This one I simply crossed at the trail, though it was waist deep and moving well.
- immediately after was another sizable climb, the first few miles of which were covered with blooming wildflowers and huge eratic boulders dotting pristinely polishes granite
- The peak involved some snow crossings. Often on these I simply improvise a route.
- Crossed Tilden Creek, rather mellow
- Descended into mosquito hell. Stop moving for more than a second and you’re covered. Really terrible.
- Passed Wilma Lake, which was high enough to cover the trail in multiple areas as it followed the shoreline
- Approached Falls Creek by around 5:45 and was immediately sketched out. Around 50ft across, deep, and although not white water was flowing fast enough to go “wow.”
- Scopes around a bit for a better crossing but at the trail seemed best.
- Waded in and was immediately up to my chest. Because the flow was so strong it required leaning strongly forward, which starts to put you on your toes. I began getting light on my feet as I inched across and had flashbacks of slipping at Bear Creek.
- Began moving back to land, frustrated knowing that I’d *probably* be fine, but unable to get over the physiological hurdle.
- Began quickly setting up camp, drenched, to avoid the mosquito onslaught.
- Around 5 minutes after getting camp up a hiker I had seen earlier in the day approached, sized up the crossing, and made it. This frustrates me, as now I was soaking wet sitting inside my tent and getting everything else wet.
- I decided to settle in and eat some. Unfortunately water was low, and I was not about to go outside and get eaten alive by misquitos, so I sat and ate half a jar of peanut butter while listening to an episode of In Our Time on the philosopher Henri Bergson about the human experience of time passing and how that differs from a scientific measurement of time.
- Planning to wake up early to cross, hopefully the water level is noticeably lower. Not looking forward to putting all my wet clothes back on in the cold air.

- woke up at 6:45 and was going by 7:15
- Stopped by soda springs, where cold water bubbles up naturally carbonated. No one is sure quite what the process is.
- Filled up my water bottle while fighting off misquitos
- Incredible rock formations, glacially polished
- The incredibly impressive Tuolmne Falls. Huge. Difference in water level between three weeks ago and now.
- After descending to the junction for Glen Aylin Sierra Camp the trail climbs for several miles.
- The cascades over The smooth granite is remarkable
- although the sun is rising the number of pines provides welcome relief from the direct sunlight
- I crest the ridge and begin descending towards McCabe Creek, which is notoriously difficult. In 2017, another high snow year, it was the other creek where someone slipped and perished.
- I take lunch on its banks and consider a plan. After eating I walk upstream a bit and see some thin logs running halfway across the stream over white water and leading to much calmer and shallow water for the rest of the crossing.
- I hop up on the boulder and feel out the logs. They’re unstable, but I take a few steps out looking down to see how they handle the load.
- Looking down makes crossings very difficult. Not so much because it’s frightening (although sometimes it is) but because the movement is disorienting and makes you feel off balance.
- I give myself a moment to rest, then start across again. Quickly I’m within reach of the next boulder, so I lean over and stick it.
- Relieved, I continue wading through the calmer thigh-deep water.
- Next we’re a few more creek crossings. I was surprised at both how deep (generally thigh) and fast the water was moving despite looking calm.
- Up another ridge, then back down, around 1500ft each way.
- Thought I might have been near a bear as I hear a noise and look up to see a pine tree rapidly swaying. I make some sound but don’t near anything else. Sometimes pine trees fall over under the weight of snow and become buried. I think that may have happened here.
- Upon reaching the top I pass miller lake, which id love to return to later in life for a swim
- Continuing down I cross Matterhorn Creek, which is very similar to the others.
- It’s only around 4:30, so I decide to continue with the mornings plan of crossing Benson Pass, the next big climb.
- The view of the valley below is absolutely beautiful. The trail follows a large stream which I cross back and forth several times.
- I’m feeling great, and am enjoying every minute.
- The trail flattens out briefly twice before the final approach climb to the saddle.
- I’m surprised by how much snow is still up here, however it is nowhere near what Donohue was.
- Reaching the top I notice some massive thunder cells behind me. Fortunately they do not look to be moving my direction, however it’s likely a good idea not to stay on the pass.
- Starting the descent the trail could not be in better condition. The snow is entirely clear on the side of the small canyon on which the trail runs, and the other is still caked in snow.
- I do around a mile and a half before rounding a corner and seeing some of the most breathtaking campsites I have seen yet.
- It’s 6:30 and I want to push another 5 miles to Benson Lake… but these are just too good, and there is a fire ring, so I decide to treat myself after a day or substantial elevation gain—somewhere around 5000ft of ascent and 4600ft of descent.
- I make camp and gather firewood, such a relaxing process. The sun continues to approach the horizon and I sit down to recap the day a bit while watching the shadows climb the sheer granite walls across the meadow in the valley below.
- With around 15 minutes before the sun set i started the fire, which quickly grew into an inferno.
- After then sun set and the shadow of the earth began its journey overhead I began prepairing dinner for the evening, pad Thai.
- Remarkably in the two hours since arriving no one passed me. Likely fear of doing snowy passes later in the day. I’m not disssapointed, this feels like one of the more profound moments on trail yet.
- Perfect little stream near camp, sound of the huge falls nearby.
- After the sun went down the air became incredibly still
- Moon three quarters full, casting shadows on the cliffs
- Effectively did the JMT. Seemed to fly by
- Look up and see a satellite flair up overhead

- slept in till 7:30
- Grabbed a coffee from the lodge and rented a bike for a ride around the park
- Went from half dome village, to mirror lake, to El Cap, back to the village. Probably a 12 mile loop
- The scale of El Cap is remarkable. Picturing the geological process and timescales involved is incomprehensible
- Broke down camp and hopped the bus to Yosemite village.
- Museum is fun. Caught a screening of a 20 minute short on Yosemite by Ken burns. Great in the AC. Interesting to watch imagery of something, then exit the building directly into the picture in which you just observed.
- Stopped by the loft and got a taco salad, likely the best food directly in the valley itself.
- Being here is complex. Drinking rose in arguably the most sublime landscape I’ve been in on the trip. How people relate to it. What it asks of the visitor. What are the conveniences. What are the demand. Again I think of air conditioning and junk space
- How the road relates to accessibility, public awareness.
- Yosemite was like the aqueduct in its polarizing position on trail. Those hiking view it as a tourist trap, but I found it one of the best destinations in how it prompted a complex series of questions I found myself returning to throughout the duration of my stay.
- Yosemite as an image which you may visit and inhabit. The power of imaging and photography in the history of making it a national park. Etc.
- Certainly plan to return here to do some loops outside the immediate valley. Very glad I stopped in.
- caught the 4:05 YARTS bus towards Mammoth out to Tuolmne Meadows. had a nice conversation with two people starting the JMT from theee about conditions.
- Right after getting off the bus ran into the two Australians from early in the Sierra. They hitched into Lee Vining to resupply. Daway is still in Mammoth.
- Talked to a ranger who said it’s fine for backpackers to stay at the backpacker camp in Tuolmne csmpground. Go figure, after all that! Still happy with how it ended up.
- Ran into CalEarth, someone i last saw perhaps in the first 100 miles. Wild!
- Going to bed early and plan to get started very early to make up for what is effectively a zero day.

July 9

- woke up at 5:45am and planned to finish the day a few miles short of Benson Pass, around a 27 mile day
- First 5 miles were super cruisy and insanely beautiful. Steam rising off patches of water through the valley.
- Got to Tuolmne Meadows and indeed the general store was closed. Told the guy “really wanted a burger” and he replied “plenty of burgers in the valley.”
- This made me consider going into Yosemite Valley proper. I’ve never gone due to my aversion to large crowds and traffic even having lived in Los Angeles almost a decade.
- At hour and a half drive away it wasn’t exactly close, but much of the traffic on the 120 goes into the valley.
- Told myself if I get a hitch in the next 15 minutes I’ll go.
- Before I even got to the corner a car pulled up. Someone who had camped next to me had met a friend and was driving into San Fransisco. Amazing!
- The friend had done the PCT in 2010 and the CDT in 2013. Said the CDT was their favorite and had me thinking about that for later in life…
- The dropped me off where the 120 intersects Big Oak Road into the park.
- After 2 minutes a huge Range Rover pulls over. “Hop in!”
- The couple was from San Fransisco and had last been here 10 years ago. Super nice.
- Driving into the valley was immense. The scale is profound. Very happy to have made the decision to stop in.
- Dropped me off at Half Dome Village.
- Got the scoop for the Backpackers Camp, a dedicated camp for those with wilderness permits and thru-hikes. decided to stay the night and leave tomorrow evening. Backpackers camp is off the map and def the place to be. 
- got a burger and had a long conversation while sharing a table with Kathy and Phillip from london.
- Ran into familiar faces from the trail and ordered a pizza for later.
- Watched the setting sunlight illuminate half dome from a meadow as the shadows inched their way up its exposed face.
- Met an Australian geologist who is on trail and talked a lot about glacial morphology and uplift.
- Scoring free pizza
- Hopped in my tent at 9:30 with plans to wake up at 7:30 for coffee and a bike around the park.

- woke up at 5:30
- Watch morning sun hit the minnarettes with golden light
- Incredibly beautiful out here
- Good climb. Start to reach patchy snow but the boot track is well defined
- 10 miles by 10:30
- Got the first pass, island pass, which feels nothing like a pass.
- Run into some small section hikers going NOBO. A couple going SOBO.
- Decent slog up to Donahue pass. Lots of snow but great boot track.
- Can see all of the Hugh Sierra back behind me.
- Snack at the top
- Start heading down to make it into Tuolmne Meadows for dinner. Rumor is it opened on the 7th.
- Incredible to go from huge snow fields stretching miles to huge meadows.
- The trail here sinks 6” deep into the ground, so defined. Like a highway.
- Pass maybe 15 people going nobo, all JMT. I guess a ton of them turn around? Before silver pass I only ran into maybe three in the whole high Sierra.
- Hear rumors of tuolmne being closed still… also can not camp within 4 miles of it. Means I’d have to push another 8, around a 30 mile day.
- Decide that might be a mistake to push big coming off three zeros, and instead to camp with some people I hadn’t seen since the aqueduct.
- Feels sacreligious setting up camp at 4:00pm. Also p great to have put 20 in by 4 considering 13 of those was heading up to the pass or snow walking.
- Decide to take the evening to write.
- Plan is to wake up pretty early and push big to

- Zeroed 4/5/6 an nero’d 7 win Lily.
- Woke up and cleaned
- Pulling out of the rental the road closures for the 4th of July parade are creating chaos
- We pull in to a spot to get breakfast but realize that road is about to be closed for hours, which would trap us
- Make a fast escape and head out of town towards Lee Vining, the eastern gateway to Yosemite and adjacent Mono Lake.
- Eat At Nicelys. So good.
- We go to Travertine hot springs. So good. The spine of the springs.
- Stop into Bridgeport. Total Fourth of July pandemonium. Quite the scene. Stop by the small museum for a break.
- Decide to get a room in Lee Vining. Relax and take it easy.
- Guided tour at Mono Lake of the Tuffa
- Geologic history. Huge caldera. Eruption 700k years ago. Huge.
- Mono lake was on the brink of ecological collapse, and would’ve shared the same fate as Owens lake to the south due to the construction of the Los Angeles aqueduct.
- Group of volenteers came together to save it. La stepped up.
- Breakfast at Latte Da. Good sandwhiches.
- Stop at Hot Creek, another hot springs
- Decided to go Kayak at Lake Crowley.
- Volcanic pillars
- Calm water when starting. Hung around and snacked near the pillars. Realized the wind was picking up.
- Really strong headwind. Took a while to get back.
- Made s reservation st the restersunt st Convict Lake
- Dispersed car camping off Owens River rd.
- Went into big bear for breakfast at the stove. Very good.
- Decided to get a room there for the night, and that I’d get back on trail the next day.
- Needed some gear, like new trekking poles. Mammoth didn’t have them, so we drove down to Bishop.
- Picked them up, and did some laundry at the laundromat while we got Mexican food.
- Stopped by the Paiute museum. Good exhibit on Paiute irrigation system and the Los Angeles aqueduct.
- Drove back to mammoth. Resupplied. Checked into hotel and watched trashy tv and really relaxed for a while.
- Went our to grab drinks to celebrate the down time.
- Woke up in the morning and went to the bakery across the street.
- Drove to the lot to catch the shuttle to reds meadow, where I had exited.
- Got lunch at the cafe at reds. Insanely good milkshake.
- Hiked to rainbow falls. Impressive.
- Hiked along the PCT with lily to devils post pile. So good.
- Valley filled with lava. Geological processes. The earthquakes in Ridgecrest. Such extreme landscapes formed by extreme lroceessss here. Happening in real time. 
- Waited for the shuttle to take lily back to the car.
- Extremely hard to say goodbye. Lily is the absolute best.
- Got started at 5:30pm
- Did a quick 10 miles and posted up with an insane view of the valley below and the minnarettes above

- luckily had a great night of sleep
- Got going at 6
- Silver creek WAY more mellow now. A non issue to cross
- Lots of snow and sun cups up silver.
- The trail goes up over a ridge after the pass, which is funny. It’s then super steep down from there.
- Several glissades down, but it’s early and way too icey. I go down one and rip by butt up. Like a slice of knives.
- Follow The trail down into the valley only to go right back up into snow. Super patchy and impossible to navigate the boot track . Getting very frustrated.
- Back down into a valley and... back up into snow at lake Virginia or purple. 
- Almost like doing three passes in a day.
- Trail totally non-existant and actually pissed now. A few primal screams. Felt pretty good actually.
- Finally past Duck Lake the snow stops, and the trail is essentially entirely downhill to reds meadow.
- So excited. Get a little service and call lily to come up with a plan.
- Last 8 miles fly by.
- I get to reds meadow and… lily can’t drive down the last 8 miles of road. The website says open, but apparently private cars can not drive the last 8 miles, and the shuttle doesn’t start until tomorrow.
- No onen is leaving and the only option is to road walk. I’m extremely frustrated as we have an Airbnb booked for the night and it’s 5:30pm. Will take around 3 hours to walk this.
- A white van approaches and I stand in the middle of the road. It stops and I explain. He says he’s not going back up tonight. I say “my girlfriend is waiting st the gate. How long does it take to drive 8 miles? I’ll give you $50… I’m going to lose it if I can’t get up there.”
- He relents and is super gracious and nice. He lives down here in a camper at devils post pile and does trail maintenance.
- I feel so bad for imposing, so lily and i gift him and his girlfriend one of our favorite bottles of wine lily had brought up from Los Angeles.
- We make it into mammoth and go shopping for groceries to make dinner in our rental.
- Salmon, quinoa, fresh greens… mmmm.
- Have a great time cooking it and catching up.
- Lily is the best.

- Walked the 1.5 miles to the dock on lake edison to take the ferry To VVR
- boat is fun
- Get there and order the mountaineer special, a ton of food
- Resupply for the next day into mammoth. Frustrating to run short so close to the goal but oh well.
- Post up at the edge of the lake in a sun chair and get some writing done. Hard to find time for this.
- Go order lunch, a burger.
- Started to feel real sick. Pretty sure I just put way too much food in my stomach. Hiker hunger is real but capacity is an issue.
- Take the ferry back.
- Those 1.5 miles to the junction feel awful.
- Frustrating to end up right back where I was at the end of yesterday. Stopping in VVR not wort it, should’ve woken up this morning and just hit the pass after getting some food.
- now basically no buffer for getting into mammoth.
- make camp a mile short of silver creek. Plan to hit it early in the morning and push hard.

July 1

- woke up around the standard time right now, about 6:30, when sunlight first hits the walls of my tent. Very difficult to get up when everything is cold and wet otherwise
- today is selden pass. At 10913ft it’s quite lower than the previous few passes.
- Shortly After i begin walking I hit snow, a familiar story over the past few days.
- Navigation is rather straightforward with good footprints
- Go between Sallie Keys Lakes. Super blue water in the lower lake, light blue ice in the higher one
- Mix of snow and trail up
- Reached the top and took a few minutes to relax. Started talking w/ Waldo about analogical thought and the trail as environment relative the internet
- just as I was about to leave Mac comes over the ridge, good to see him after him having left to hit forester earlier in the day after those rough first stream crossings 
- We catch up a bit and I begin heading down first
- Sloshy snow conducive to run/skiing
- Eventually this turns into the hellish patchy dry/snow trail, where the single foot path gives way to 40 and navigation becomes impossible
- I try to stay near there trail, but there are no footpaths around here.
- while going over a snow bank the ground suddenly gives way and I fall into a hole up to my armpits, dangling with my feet in the void beneath me. The dreaded full body posthole
- I try to look down and see a giant boulder just ahead of me and water underneath, having eroded away the snow
- This was mildly terrifying, and after a second to realize what had happened I slowly rolled onto my side and slid on my stomach to dry ground
- i continued my search for the trail and finally came across it reliably.
- Followed it down through lots of snow piles and mud until reaching the edge of Bear Creek
- These stream crossings have been underwhelming so far. I spot a line where the stream splits into two around a small island and decide to give it a go.
- It’s feeling good, although the water is about waist high. I’m about halfway across when I go to place my left foot and all the sudden there are no rocks to plant on. I’ve shifted my weight just enough to suddenly be spun 180 degrees facing down stream and up to my neck in water. I panic and manage to get my footing but am fighting hard for it. Not having the stability of my now broken trekking pole makes this even more difficult to stabilize.
- I manage to rotate back around and make it back to where I started, a little shaken.
- I stand there and try to assess what just happened so quickly. I walk down around 50ft to an area which appears to have a more consistent ground and make it across, slowly, with relative ease.
- I launch my remaining trekking pole across the meadow and sit down to take it in. Shit.
- Mac catches up and crosses right at the trail with no issues at all. he’s a solid 4 inches taller than me and around 160 to my 130.
- I would’ve stayed longer but the misquitos are eating me up, so I grab my pole and start walking again.
- Before long I see a yellow jacket sitting in the grass along the trail. They look up and it’s psyched from yesterday.
- “I just ate shit on that last crossing” she said. Me too! She managed to get swept a bit and luckily regained her footing after several feet.
- We were both confused about how that could’ve happened after all the previous successful crossings.
- She doesn’t want to cross the next streams alone, so we begin moving forwards as a group.
- The next few streams are mellow, and it’s nice to be pushing with friends as opposed to solo the past few days
- We reach an uphill slog which is feeling unusually difficult. I’m running very low on food and have only had a breakfast bar today. I pause to eat a cliff bar and Mac catches up and asks what’s up. I tell him and he gives me a few tortillas with Siracha and spikes my water with electrolytes.
- I immediately feel way better. Damn!
- We climb the remaining slog, which it turns out isn’t so bad, and then begin a big series of tight switchbacks descending 2000ft all at once.
- A bridge is at the base and psyched is there hanging out. She eats some food as we take a quick break and then begin.
- We pass a sign for VVR. It has been my plan for the past week to stop here for food and a quick resupply to get me to mammoth, but with psyched and Mac pushing straight through I want to also. Plus, lone pine to mammoth is an insane push in a snow year like this.
- We begin pushing up silver pass and soon negotiate a large river crossing with a massive fallen log.
- We then have to cross back over the river, this time in another more obscured log 100 yards downstream
- This one is sketchier, the log wet and just above the surface of the rushing water 
- We continue pushing upwards and I’m finding it’s very difficult. To stay locked in a rhythm I begin playing entire familiar albums back in my head, but at the tempo of my walking, adjusting for variations in the terrain. It’s the only thing keeping me from slowing to a halt.
- After a whole of this I see psyched come to a spot ahead and look back with a face which can only say “are you serious?”
- Ahead of us is a huge cascade of water, followed by a few feet of narrow trail submerged under rushing white water, followed immediately by a plunging waterfall. this does not look good.
- Mac comes over and we start laughing. For real? This? Now?
- Mac sizes it up as psyched and I shake our heads. He eases in and is quickly up to his waste and clearly fighting for his footing.
- He makes it to a calmer area guarded by a boulder as the water sprays from the cascade above
- He continues pushing and gets to an extremely sketchy area where you must climb over a boulder submerged in the fastest flowing white water
- For a moment it almost looks like he loses it, but he manages to make it over
- Shit... this is the guy who just eased through bear creek earlier, who I’ve crossed a few streams with, and that’s the tensest I’ve seen him.
- I think about the sensation earlier of all that water pushing against my body after slipping in bear creek. If that happened here you’d be over the falls before knowing what happened.
- Psyched is not psyched about the idea, and over a period of around 15 minutes we play a game of “fuck no” charades with Mac across the raging water.
- Eventually he relents and continues up trail, only after having began to make his way back with spare tortillas for me to eat over the next two days to mammoth, at which I charaded “you’re nuts, thanks but don’t risk it!”
- Psyched and I start coming up with options.
- Camp here and try in the morning when the water level is lower? But we’re at relatively low elevation and the melt is likely to continue overnight.
- Try scrambling over the rocky cliff to the east of the crossing to bypass it? Sure, but it’s much easier to upclimb something than it is to downclimb, and getting stuck on a ledge sounds terrible
- We sit and weigh numerous variations of these and other options until deciding to turn back to VVR and take a side trail to mammoth. She’s also super low on food, and the compounding factors convince us to turn back and shoot for that. of course this is funny, as it was my original plan all along. Oh well.
- We begin heading back and make it about a mile before running into two PCT hikers coming from VVR. We begin talking and they seem surprised. I tell them it was just a super bad feeling, and psyched walks through the day (bear creek, etc) and how the decision was made.
- They plan to camp just before the crossing and hope for better water levels in the morning, and if not to attempt a scramble of the rocks to the east up to a meadow as mentioned my Skurka
- I’m set in heading to VVR, so I say goodbye and continue down.
- After maybe another mile I run into airborne and legend. Oh shit! They seem super surprised to see me headed south. I explain and they seem understanding. “Go get some food!!” Their plan is to camp and try in the morning.
- I admit I was quite disappointed at this point, but committed to doing what felt safe, and that it had been my original plan helped things along. It’s important to keep things in perspective. There is no redo on slipping and going over those falls. The series of events through the day almost served as premonitions or precautions. You ate shit in bear creek to avoid doing that here.
- As i reach the signage for the trail leading to VVR the daylight is getting dim and I see a fire glowing. It’s stokes!
- He’s cleaned up what was a messy camp and stone fire ring and is cooking dinner.
- “I stopped at Muir ranch and all these hikers getting off trail gave me their food!” He’s loaded and offers some pasta for me to cook.
- This is my first fire on trail, and it came at the perfect time.
- I scarf down some hot pasta and sit next to the fire with the sound of the raging Mono Creek in the background.
- We catch up and it’s real good. I set up camp and continue to eat the last of my food.
- The boat ferrying hikers across lake Edison departs at 9:45am tomorrow, and the hike is only 1.5 miles. We plan to catch that and continue talking about our days.
- We put out the fire and I get into my tent with a full stomach, relieved.
- Thinking about my capabilities and the guy I helped at walker, etc...
- Need to ensure I can make it to mammoth either way in two days to meet lily. Very excited for that.
- Plans, etc…

- of course woke up later than intended, around 6:30. Had a great sleep tho!
- Got on the trail around 7:15
- almost immediately on snow heading up to Muir pass, a very mild one compared to yesterday, but infamous for the miles of snow travel above 10k
- Luckily navigation was fairly easy, and the footpath quite well defined.
- As elevation increased the scene became increasingly otherworldly—an ice planet
- As the sun continued to rise the snow began to soften. There were brief sections of steep grade, but fortunately there weren’t points of real danger
- After around 6 miles the Muir Hut came into view over the top of the pass, amazing
- Hung out inside for a while, ate a pop tart and drank some (cold) coffee. (architect, design, sitting inside)
- Ran into stokes who it turns out was just ahead of me.
- Began my way down. Things really beginning to get slushy. Rather than fight the slip slide it’s best to embrace it and slide into each step. I get into a rhythm and am basically running down the pass.
- There are sometimes multiple footpaths, the older ones sometime terminating at freshly thawed ice lakes.
- The only real sketchy part is navigating some steep inclines directly adjacent icey water. Slip and you’re going for a very very cold swim.
- I make it to a river crossing and hop over. I may have been overly excited as one of my trekking poles gets stuck between two rocks and snaps in half. Shit!
- The trail briefly emerges only to be obscured again by snow. The footpaths end full stop leaving me wondering where to go, and my gps refuses to update.
- I end up making a big quarter mile circle trying to locate the trail again, wasting maybe 20 minutes. Frustrating immediately after the pole snapping.
- Navigation continues to be hard. Some people lunching on a boulder across a stream see me and shout “the trail is over here!”
- The trail from here on is totally free of snow, and it I start cruising. The design of little drainage channels running between switchbacks are expertly designed here, keeping the trail mostly dry
- I run into a group I hung out with on the gravel island in the snow before Mather. They’re calling it a day and we chat about the pass.
- Then it finally happens, I get the trail name I had been pulling for—Dash. My first name is hyphenated and I sometimes walk quite fast.
- This gets me motivated and I really start to move.
- I approach the crossing for evolution creek, another notorious one. In big snow years you are directed to take an alternate route through a meadow, which I do.
- The water is maybe 4ft deep, moving briskly, and freezing. The crossing is maybe 35ft across.
- The trail keeps going down, and eventually meets the South Fork of the San Joaquin River.
- It’s incredible to follow the water from the snow at the pass down through the canyon.
- There are a number of beautiful bridges leading across it as the river and trail meander around each other
- I reach a freshly downed tree and walk through some of the branches. Its almost like a portal into how Northern California will feel—super tall densely grouped skinny pines. Amazing.
- I continue pushing and reach the boundary of the Muir Wilderness, which I walk into.
- I approach a junction to Muir Trail Ranch, and choose to skip it to continue along the PCT. Reaching this was my goal for the day, but I feel good and it’s only 5:30, so I continue. It feels great to be able to walk a full day after all these big passes.
- I decide to push for some campsites 5 miles away, and more than halfway up the 3200ft climb to Selden Pass
- It’s a real slog after all the snow traversing earlier in the day, but the misquotos are a good motivator to continue moving briskly
- I contemplate a stream crossing. My shoes are finally mostly dry after being wet most of the day, and I hate putting on cold wet shoes and socks in the morning
- There doesn’t appear to be an option for a dry crossing, so I just go for it
- The trail after this is a big wet mess of mud and water, so it would’ve been pretty futile to cross dry anyway
- I pass 10k feet and reach the campsites I was aiming for.
- because of the broken trekking pole, and my tent requiring two to be pitched, I locate a stick roughly that length and set up camp
- I make some warm food, chow mein, which is delicious
- Today was big. 12 miles of snow traversal, 27.7 miles total. Roughly 7000ft of ascent, 5350ft of descent.

- I wake up early as the sun is rising, and all the others on our island in the snow are packing there things to begin ascending.
- My quilt and pad are covered in a thick layer of frost. My bottle of water is partly frozen.
- My bag is packed hastily and I begin making my way across the remaining mile of snow to the beginning of the route which appears most promising.
- The snow is now super icy, and postholing isn’t a concern.
- Reaching the base I begin climbing a straight series of steps up the steep grade of the pass
- Reaching a patch of rocks I pause to consider the next route to take. There are several options; scramble along rocks, take a low or high foot path through the snow, etc
- The next several snow traverses increase in difficulty, and at moments I get nervous. This has less to do with the pass, and more to do with the nervous group in front of me. They keep asking if what they’re doing is correct, or where to go, and are clinging at times so hard they appear to shake. I’m glad to help, but don’t make your safety my responsibility please!
- I navigate around them by taking an alternate route about halfway through.
- Someone else is coming down the route. Apparently the sack containing his tent fell off his pack and went sliding down the side of the pass a super long way
- He gets to a point and begins self arresting down with his ice axe. Reaching his tent he begins climbing straight back up. Insane!
- I make it to the last little scramble near the cornice and reach the top. Every time someone pokes over the edge everyone claps. Good times.
- The way down looks real cruisy. I get going and hit two medium sized glissades, a little rough on the bum this early in the morning!
- The footpath diverges when reaching a series of rock patches and trees. It’s anyone’s guess which way is best. Oftentimes the actual trail is not the best way through all of this snow.
- I oscillate between taking a foot path, and when that disappears heading towards the trail, only to deviate to a better looking footpath when it comes into view.
- The sun heavily melts and obscures the foot paths during the day, making it a total guessing game
- Eventually I reach a very defined foot path only to have it lead directly into the melting lake. I guess this was heavily used a week or two ago when this lake was still frozen enough to walk on.
- This continues for a few miles over a couple hours; take a foot path, realize it’s no longer applicable, improvise.
- Eventually the trail emerges at a huge descent crossing through 10k ft adjacent the Palisade Creek waterfall. Hundreds of beautifully laid stone steps.
- Near the bottom I stopped in a large slap of granite next to the falls to snack and dry out some of my frozen gear.
- I get going and it feels great to be back on trail, even through there is a ton of water and mud. I knock out several miles super fast.
- Muir Pass is up ahead, and I’m tempted to aim for the emergency hit at the top, however a talk with a ranger puts that idea to rest as there is a marmot infestation. That in addition to 4 miles of post holing convince me to make camp just pass 10k ft, right at the snow line.
- I find an incredible spot right on the edge of a waterfall of the Middle Fork Kings River at Le Conte Canyon
- I’m being conservative with my food right now. Muir Trail Ranch is 23 miles ahead, and in addition to a few technical Challenges between here and there I’m unsure if they’re even open (as are most others I talk to.)
- If they are closed, I’ll need to make it the additional day to VVR. I have three days of food left, but trying to play it smart has me a little hungry at the end of the day. Oh well.

28

- Hit snooze twice for the 5:30 alarm, ended up being along up at 6:30.
- the sun peak up over the distant ridge just as I opened my tent. I felt lazy, but the warm sun was quite a motivator considering my shoes had frozen again overnight.
- today’s pass is Pinchot, one of the mellower passes
- The approach takes you across a very long traverse of a snow field
- It’s difficult to navigate with all the sun cups—everything looks like footsteps.
- Manage to get pretty off to footpath, but then I spot it and begin to head up the ridge to reconnect
- The route is mild compared to others, although this is not to suggest you’d want to slip
- The last hundred feet has you negotiate a cornice. After hopping over is a nice level area to hang out for a bit
- From here I can see the footpath go on for miles in the distance through snow and past frozen lakes. Hard to believe it’s almost July.
- The trail passes a creek (name) and then begins heading downhill to the Kings river, a notorious crossing having taken two lives in 2017, another big snow year
- it’s impossible to follow the trail thru here, bush wacking between sightings of footprints is the only real option
- Finally i reach the edge of the King river and come up with a plan to split the crossing into multiple smaller ones in an area where there are multiple little islands
- It ends up being pretty trivial, but when I walk back to where the trail crosses there is a lot of white water moving extremely fast
- We setup for lunch and to dry things out. Suddenly there is a massive sound. Looking up there are two fighter jets, one tailing the other, screaming through this canyon and banking at 90 degrees.
- We get going, the day has a finite amount of miles as we must wait until tomorrow to cross Mather Pass, perhaps even more frightening a pass than Forester. This is because as the sun hits the pass and warms up the snow it becomes slushy and difficult/dangerous to walk/climb on
- We begin the climb up to the approach, a good 1800ft over 4 miles. Doesn’t sound bad, but the first half is half snow half trail, making navigation incredibly hard, and since it was around 2pm everything was slush
- Eventually the trail and trees entirely disappeared as I’m standing in a field of white which goes on for miles, ending only at the ridge I need to cross tomorrow.
- I now know the true meaning of postholing, as each step either causes me to slip or sink a foot or more. It’s really exhausting to not be able to take a step with confidence over and over.
- after what seems like forever in time and relatively little in miles we arrive at a gravely oasis in the snow. Very flat with room for many tents.
- A group is already there and I go to hang and talk trail as it’s only 4pm.
- I decide to cowboy camp and bundle up with every bit of clothing at my disposable.
- The sky up here is huge, and staring at it as I fall asleep the super high cirrus clouds look so close I could touch them
- I drift off and then wake up as it’s just about dark. Even now there are more stars out than I’ve ever seen before. Jupiter glows brightly, all of the snow around me reflecting the brightness of the stars
- off to my left is the Milky Way, although it looks blocked by some clouds there are still tons of stars
- I wake up later and the celestial sphere has rotated, however those clouds still appear to be blocking part of the Milky Way. It’s only then I realize it’s the dark band of the galaxy, and it only appears so dark due to the contrast with how bright everything else is!
- I fade in and out of sleep all night. Sometimes I open my eyes only to see a shooting star, or a pair of satellites moving in unison
- Unreal

- ok nights sleep. Woke up at 6 and got going by 6:45
- Today’s pass is Glenn, which has a rep for being pretty mellow
- Start heading up and run into “stokes”, who camped right at the base
- We start up together and are cruising
- The trail takes you past a massive frozen lake, the deepest blue you can imagine
- We pass some people on the way up and make it to the crest within maybe 20 minutes. That’s not to downplay the pass, it’s pretty serious
- We hang and eventually that group catches up.
- We pick a route which follows a middle line down the snow instead of a steep route down a ridge of rocks
- It’s steady super slushy at 10am and we have to be pretty careful with kicking in footsteps
- The group behind us starts to follow, making me a little nervous as this feels like a pretty aggressive route
- It’s super slow going, and we pass some areas where it is clear people fell then walked their way back over to the route
- We make it down without too much trouble, but the group behind us is falling left and right
- We set up on the rocks below and watch the situation unfold as more people start down the ridge
- Honestly it’s kind of scary to watch people slip and slide down this thing, could easily get yourself into a real bad situation
- Eventually we decide to just get going, and start the long descent to the valley below
- Lots of snow, and pseudo skiing
- Incredibly blue lakes with super freezing water we have to wade through. Surprisingly strong current even tho no white water
- The valley continues to open up as we follow a large river and a huge waterfall emerges in the distance
- We near one of the more notorious water crossings and keep an eye out for alternate spots to cross as we are upstream
- We spot something solid, about waist high and flowing moderately fast, and cross without issue thinking we’re real smart
- We start bush wacking the half mile to the trail when we notice... wait a second, we’re on the wrong side of the water!
- Somehow now we have to cross two distinct streams, both just as involved as the one we had just done
- I find a line and shoot across real quick, stokes follows
- We make it back up to the trail and break for late lunch at 3:30
- After all the redundant crossings and bush wacking a few faces we passed much earlier in the day now pass us. Oh well.
- I dry out my tent as there had been frost all over it in the morning
- We get going again after a quarter hour and continue the descent into the valley
- It’s super wet everywhere. The trail is 1/3 snow, 1/3 stream, 1/3 dry.
- We enter a zone with some huge pines, and before long are at the infamous suspension bridge across woods creek.
- We cross and start the long climb up to just short of Pinot pass, putting us in good position to hit the pass tomorrow morning.
- Following the waterfall up, lots of cool foliage and a nice breeze through the canyon
- Mile 800!
- A decent creek crossing. Some others are trying to scoot along a log, but we spend 30 seconds analyzing a line and powered thru
- Continued the slog up to twin lakes
- Searched around and located two good sites with an incredible view of the lakes and mountains
- Made some Mac and cheese, great sunset
- Very solid day. Tomorrow is an early morning for Pinot, then a very mellow afternoon cruise to set up camp at the base of Mather

- woke up kind of late, after the sun rough creek crossing last night and subsequent freeze I was not eager to get out of the warm quilt.
- unsure if I want to hit forester today, or wait for some of the people I had been hiking with to catch up by taking a trail zero
- Ultimately I decide to at least dry things out and pack things up.
- While doing this I ran into a few familiar faces.
- Not wanting to just sit around all day, I begin hiking towards forester pass, the highest point on the pct and the first major pass.
- If I wasn’t feeling it I’d simply make camp at one of the sites near the base.
- The approach was covered in snow for around 5 miles. Came up behind another hiker and we got to taking.
- Decided to take a break w/ him and his pal. Turned out I was behind Airborne who yoyo’d the PCT last year. His friend was Legend, who had set a number of FKTs including the AZT just before getting here. Damn!
- We hang for a few and then continue our approach to Mather at around 11am. I’m pretty confident to be hitting it with two of the greats.
- Legend leads and starts kicking steps basically straight up the damn thing in nothing but trail runners. No spikes, crampons, ice-axe, etc. Airbore follows and I’m right behind, but with spikes on. It’s like going up a ladder made of snow.
- We’re flying up this thing and passing people doing the switchbacks. We notice a few people at the base begin to follow our aggressive approach and are a little concerned, but fortunately they cross over to the switchbacks before long.
- We teach a rocky outcrop and start basically climbing/scrambling up. The views are insane and we’re having a blast
- We reach the trail and follow a few more dry switchbacks up before hitting the sketchiest part; the chute.
- This thing is near vertical and drops into boulders with tiny footsteps in the snow
- Legend hits it first and kicks in some solid steps, airborne zooms across and I follow not far behind. A quick round of fist bumps and we continue to the apex of the pass.
- Hitting the top we navigate around a cornice and jump over the edge.
- there is plenty of clear ground, quite a change from even a week ago.
- Of course we hang for a little to take it all in. It’s insane up here. Words don’t do it justice.
- We begin eyeing up our route down and decide to take the high line to the left.
- Legend basically starts running this, and it turns out to be super fun as the afternoon sun has made everything quite slushy. You can essentially push with your poles and psuedo-ski down. Too fucking fun!
- We power down to a ridge and walk along the boulders on the top, improvising a route as we descend
- We hit the trail and only stay on it for a moment when Airborne notices some glissade paths. They’re massive.
- He begins down climbing over the edge of the trail. The rocks have melted away some of the snow leaving a descent sheer gap between the start of the glissade and your footing points
- He basically jumps, lands in the chute and starts flying down, at least 800 vertical feet
- I ask legend if he has any tips for someone who has never glissade before. “Pick your route and let go till the end”
- He jumps down and is off
- This leaves me, having never glissaded, about to go for the first time off the tallest pass of the PCT. Fuck it!
- I downclimb, and as I do a smart water bottle falls out of a side pocket on my pack into the sheer gap between the rocks and the snow. Shit! At least it did t have the sawyer on it.
- I carefully negotiate the footing and decide, here it goes.
- speed picks up insanely fast and there is nothing you can do but hope for the best
- I make it to the bottom and stand up with the last little bit of inertia. Stuck the landing! I’m super hyped and can barely see anything with snow spray all over my glasses.
- We continue to basically run down, improvising a route into the valley below.
- We split up, finding our own routes off trail, which was super fun, and run into each other at a small opening in the pines next to the creek, the trail just above our position
- We break for lunch and don’t say much. The day has been too immense. some hikers stop by who I ran into earlier while breaking down camp, they must have had a three hour head start, but here they are catching up at the end of our lunch break!
- We locate a down log to cross the creek, a little sketchy but not as bad as yesterday
- At this point the trail is half dry, half snow. It’s very easy to follow and the surrounding scenery of huge cliffs really is impressive
- We enter an area where earlier this year an avalanche hit. There are tons of huge downed trees, the smell of fresh pine still in the air. Amazing how much power one of these has, snapping towering pines like toothpicks.
- After a few miles we run into a ranger doing permit checks. “Is this all you guys bring with you? You started today where?!”
- Next was a solid slog up to where the trail junctions to kearsarge pass heading off trail. A few miles of a steep grade.
- I have enough food to make it around five or six days, so I’m going to stay on while they exit
- We reach the junction and say goodbye. What an insanely good day.
- I go another mile or so and set up camp pretty early at 7:30pm in an area with no one else around
- It’s nice to cook dinner and watch the clouds turn gold the pink in solitude and think about the day
- I’m reminded of a similarly amazing sunset at Apache Spring in San jacinto. It seems like so long ago. The time on trail ha definitely moved beyond the sense of being relegated to recent memory.
