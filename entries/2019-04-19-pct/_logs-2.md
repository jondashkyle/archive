July 1

- woke up around the standard time right now, about 6:30, when sunlight first hits the walls of my tent. Very difficult to get up when everything is cold and wet otherwise
- today is selden pass. At 10913ft it’s quite lower than the previous few passes.
- Shortly After i begin walking I hit snow, a familiar story over the past few days.
- Navigation is rather straightforward with good footprints
- Go between Sallie Keys Lakes. Super blue water in the lower lake, light blue ice in the higher one
- Mix of snow and trail up
- Reached the top and took a few minutes to relax. Started talking w/ Waldo about analogical thought and the trail as environment relative the internet
- just as I was about to leave Mac comes over the ridge, good to see him after him having left to hit forester earlier in the day after those rough first stream crossings 
- We catch up a bit and I begin heading down first
- Sloshy snow conducive to run/skiing
- Eventually this turns into the hellish patchy dry/snow trail, where the single foot path gives way to 40 and navigation becomes impossible
- I try to stay near there trail, but there are no footpaths around here.
- while going over a snow bank the ground suddenly gives way and I fall into a hole up to my armpits, dangling with my feet in the void beneath me. The dreaded full body posthole
- I try to look down and see a giant boulder just ahead of me and water underneath, having eroded away the snow
- This was mildly terrifying, and after a second to realize what had happened I slowly rolled onto my side and slid on my stomach to dry ground
- i continued my search for the trail and finally came across it reliably.
- Followed it down through lots of snow piles and mud until reaching the edge of Bear Creek
- These stream crossings have been underwhelming so far. I spot a line where the stream splits into two around a small island and decide to give it a go.
- It’s feeling good, although the water is about waist high. I’m about halfway across when I go to place my left foot and all the sudden there are no rocks to plant on. I’ve shifted my weight just enough to suddenly be spun 180 degrees facing down stream and up to my neck in water. I panic and manage to get my footing but am fighting hard for it. Not having the stability of my now broken trekking pole makes this even more difficult to stabilize.
- I manage to rotate back around and make it back to where I started, a little shaken.
- I stand there and try to assess what just happened so quickly. I walk down around 50ft to an area which appears to have a more consistent ground and make it across, slowly, with relative ease.
- I launch my remaining trekking pole across the meadow and sit down to take it in. Shit.
- Mac catches up and crosses right at the trail with no issues at all. he’s a solid 4 inches taller than me and around 160 to my 130.
- I would’ve stayed longer but the misquitos are eating me up, so I grab my pole and start walking again.
- Before long I see a yellow jacket sitting in the grass along the trail. They look up and it’s psyched from yesterday.
- “I just ate shit on that last crossing” she said. Me too! She managed to get swept a bit and luckily regained her footing after several feet.
- We were both confused about how that could’ve happened after all the previous successful crossings.
- She doesn’t want to cross the next streams alone, so we begin moving forwards as a group.
- The next few streams are mellow, and it’s nice to be pushing with friends as opposed to solo the past few days
- We reach an uphill slog which is feeling unusually difficult. I’m running very low on food and have only had a breakfast bar today. I pause to eat a cliff bar and Mac catches up and asks what’s up. I tell him and he gives me a few tortillas with Siracha and spikes my water with electrolytes.
- I immediately feel way better. Damn!
- We climb the remaining slog, which it turns out isn’t so bad, and then begin a big series of tight switchbacks descending 2000ft all at once.
- A bridge is at the base and psyched is there hanging out. She eats some food as we take a quick break and then begin.
- We pass a sign for VVR. It has been my plan for the past week to stop here for food and a quick resupply to get me to mammoth, but with psyched and Mac pushing straight through I want to also. Plus, lone pine to mammoth is an insane push in a snow year like this.
- We begin pushing up silver pass and soon negotiate a large river crossing with a massive fallen log.
- We then have to cross back over the river, this time in another more obscured log 100 yards downstream
- This one is sketchier, the log wet and just above the surface of the rushing water 
- We continue pushing upwards and I’m finding it’s very difficult. To stay locked in a rhythm I begin playing entire familiar albums back in my head, but at the tempo of my walking, adjusting for variations in the terrain. It’s the only thing keeping me from slowing to a halt.
- After a whole of this I see psyched come to a spot ahead and look back with a face which can only say “are you serious?”
- Ahead of us is a huge cascade of water, followed by a few feet of narrow trail submerged under rushing white water, followed immediately by a plunging waterfall. this does not look good.
- Mac comes over and we start laughing. For real? This? Now?
- Mac sizes it up as psyched and I shake our heads. He eases in and is quickly up to his waste and clearly fighting for his footing.
- He makes it to a calmer area guarded by a boulder as the water sprays from the cascade above
- He continues pushing and gets to an extremely sketchy area where you must climb over a boulder submerged in the fastest flowing white water
- For a moment it almost looks like he loses it, but he manages to make it over
- Shit... this is the guy who just eased through bear creek earlier, who I’ve crossed a few streams with, and that’s the tensest I’ve seen him.
- I think about the sensation earlier of all that water pushing against my body after slipping in bear creek. If that happened here you’d be over the falls before knowing what happened.
- Psyched is not psyched about the idea, and over a period of around 15 minutes we play a game of “fuck no” charades with Mac across the raging water.
- Eventually he relents and continues up trail, only after having began to make his way back with spare tortillas for me to eat over the next two days to mammoth, at which I charaded “you’re nuts, thanks but don’t risk it!”
- Psyched and I start coming up with options.
- Camp here and try in the morning when the water level is lower? But we’re at relatively low elevation and the melt is likely to continue overnight.
- Try scrambling over the rocky cliff to the east of the crossing to bypass it? Sure, but it’s much easier to upclimb something than it is to downclimb, and getting stuck on a ledge sounds terrible
- We sit and weigh numerous variations of these and other options until deciding to turn back to VVR and take a side trail to mammoth. She’s also super low on food, and the compounding factors convince us to turn back and shoot for that. of course this is funny, as it was my original plan all along. Oh well.
- We begin heading back and make it about a mile before running into two PCT hikers coming from VVR. We begin talking and they seem surprised. I tell them it was just a super bad feeling, and psyched walks through the day (bear creek, etc) and how the decision was made.
- They plan to camp just before the crossing and hope for better water levels in the morning, and if not to attempt a scramble of the rocks to the east up to a meadow as mentioned my Skurka
- I’m set in heading to VVR, so I say goodbye and continue down.
- After maybe another mile I run into airborne and legend. Oh shit! They seem super surprised to see me headed south. I explain and they seem understanding. “Go get some food!!” Their plan is to camp and try in the morning.
- I admit I was quite disappointed at this point, but committed to doing what felt safe, and that it had been my original plan helped things along. It’s important to keep things in perspective. There is no redo on slipping and going over those falls. The series of events through the day almost served as premonitions or precautions. You ate shit in bear creek to avoid doing that here.
- As i reach the signage for the trail leading to VVR the daylight is getting dim and I see a fire glowing. It’s stokes!
- He’s cleaned up what was a messy camp and stone fire ring and is cooking dinner.
- “I stopped at Muir ranch and all these hikers getting off trail gave me their food!” He’s loaded and offers some pasta for me to cook.
- This is my first fire on trail, and it came at the perfect time.
- I scarf down some hot pasta and sit next to the fire with the sound of the raging Mono Creek in the background.
- We catch up and it’s real good. I set up camp and continue to eat the last of my food.
- The boat ferrying hikers across lake Edison departs at 9:45am tomorrow, and the hike is only 1.5 miles. We plan to catch that and continue talking about our days.
- We put out the fire and I get into my tent with a full stomach, relieved.
- Thinking about my capabilities and the guy I helped at walker, etc...
- Need to ensure I can make it to mammoth either way in two days to meet lily. Very excited for that.
- Plans, etc…

30

- of course woke up later than intended, around 6:30. Had a great sleep tho!
- Got on the trail around 7:15
- almost immediately on snow heading up to Muir pass, a very mild one compared to yesterday, but infamous for the miles of snow travel above 10k
- Luckily navigation was fairly easy, and the footpath quite well defined.
- As elevation increased the scene became increasingly otherworldly—an ice planet
- As the sun continued to rise the snow began to soften. There were brief sections of steep grade, but fortunately there weren’t points of real danger
- After around 6 miles the Muir Hut came into view over the top of the pass, amazing
- Hung out inside for a while, ate a pop tart and drank some (cold) coffee. (architect, design, sitting inside)
- Ran into stokes who it turns out was just ahead of me.
- Began my way down. Things really beginning to get slushy. Rather than fight the slip slide it’s best to embrace it and slide into each step. I get into a rhythm and am basically running down the pass.
- There are sometimes multiple footpaths, the older ones sometime terminating at freshly thawed ice lakes.
- The only real sketchy part is navigating some steep inclines directly adjacent icey water. Slip and you’re going for a very very cold swim.
- I make it to a river crossing and hop over. I may have been overly excited as one of my trekking poles gets stuck between two rocks and snaps in half. Shit!
- The trail briefly emerges only to be obscured again by snow. The footpaths end full stop leaving me wondering where to go, and my gps refuses to update.
- I end up making a big quarter mile circle trying to locate the trail again, wasting maybe 20 minutes. Frustrating immediately after the pole snapping.
- Navigation continues to be hard. Some people lunching on a boulder across a stream see me and shout “the trail is over here!”
- The trail from here on is totally free of snow, and it I start cruising. The design of little drainage channels running between switchbacks are expertly designed here, keeping the trail mostly dry
- I run into a group I hung out with on the gravel island in the snow before Mather. They’re calling it a day and we chat about the pass.
- Then it finally happens, I get the trail name I had been pulling for—Dash. My first name is hyphenated and I sometimes walk quite fast.
- This gets me motivated and I really start to move.
- I approach the crossing for evolution creek, another notorious one. In big snow years you are directed to take an alternate route through a meadow, which I do.
- The water is maybe 4ft deep, moving briskly, and freezing. The crossing is maybe 35ft across.
- The trail keeps going down, and eventually meets the South Fork of the San Joaquin River.
- It’s incredible to follow the water from the snow at the pass down through the canyon.
- There are a number of beautiful bridges leading across it as the river and trail meander around each other
- I reach a freshly downed tree and walk through some of the branches. Its almost like a portal into how Northern California will feel—super tall densely grouped skinny pines. Amazing.
- I continue pushing and reach the boundary of the Muir Wilderness, which I walk into.
- I approach a junction to Muir Trail Ranch, and choose to skip it to continue along the PCT. Reaching this was my goal for the day, but I feel good and it’s only 5:30, so I continue. It feels great to be able to walk a full day after all these big passes.
- I decide to push for some campsites 5 miles away, and more than halfway up the 3200ft climb to Selden Pass
- It’s a real slog after all the snow traversing earlier in the day, but the misquotos are a good motivator to continue moving briskly
- I contemplate a stream crossing. My shoes are finally mostly dry after being wet most of the day, and I hate putting on cold wet shoes and socks in the morning
- There doesn’t appear to be an option for a dry crossing, so I just go for it
- The trail after this is a big wet mess of mud and water, so it would’ve been pretty futile to cross dry anyway
- I pass 10k feet and reach the campsites I was aiming for.
- because of the broken trekking pole, and my tent requiring two to be pitched, I locate a stick roughly that length and set up camp
- I make some warm food, chow mein, which is delicious
- Today was big. 12 miles of snow traversal, 27.7 miles total. Roughly 7000ft of ascent, 5350ft of descent.

- I wake up early as the sun is rising, and all the others on our island in the snow are packing there things to begin ascending.
- My quilt and pad are covered in a thick layer of frost. My bottle of water is partly frozen.
- My bag is packed hastily and I begin making my way across the remaining mile of snow to the beginning of the route which appears most promising.
- The snow is now super icy, and postholing isn’t a concern.
- Reaching the base I begin climbing a straight series of steps up the steep grade of the pass
- Reaching a patch of rocks I pause to consider the next route to take. There are several options; scramble along rocks, take a low or high foot path through the snow, etc
- The next several snow traverses increase in difficulty, and at moments I get nervous. This has less to do with the pass, and more to do with the nervous group in front of me. They keep asking if what they’re doing is correct, or where to go, and are clinging at times so hard they appear to shake. I’m glad to help, but don’t make your safety my responsibility please!
- I navigate around them by taking an alternate route about halfway through.
- Someone else is coming down the route. Apparently the sack containing his tent fell off his pack and went sliding down the side of the pass a super long way
- He gets to a point and begins self arresting down with his ice axe. Reaching his tent he begins climbing straight back up. Insane!
- I make it to the last little scramble near the cornice and reach the top. Every time someone pokes over the edge everyone claps. Good times.
- The way down looks real cruisy. I get going and hit two medium sized glissades, a little rough on the bum this early in the morning!
- The footpath diverges when reaching a series of rock patches and trees. It’s anyone’s guess which way is best. Oftentimes the actual trail is not the best way through all of this snow.
- I oscillate between taking a foot path, and when that disappears heading towards the trail, only to deviate to a better looking footpath when it comes into view.
- The sun heavily melts and obscures the foot paths during the day, making it a total guessing game
- Eventually I reach a very defined foot path only to have it lead directly into the melting lake. I guess this was heavily used a week or two ago when this lake was still frozen enough to walk on.
- This continues for a few miles over a couple hours; take a foot path, realize it’s no longer applicable, improvise.
- Eventually the trail emerges at a huge descent crossing through 10k ft adjacent the Palisade Creek waterfall. Hundreds of beautifully laid stone steps.
- Near the bottom I stopped in a large slap of granite next to the falls to snack and dry out some of my frozen gear.
- I get going and it feels great to be back on trail, even through there is a ton of water and mud. I knock out several miles super fast.
- Muir Pass is up ahead, and I’m tempted to aim for the emergency hit at the top, however a talk with a ranger puts that idea to rest as there is a marmot infestation. That in addition to 4 miles of post holing convince me to make camp just pass 10k ft, right at the snow line.
- I find an incredible spot right on the edge of a waterfall of the Middle Fork Kings River at Le Conte Canyon
- I’m being conservative with my food right now. Muir Trail Ranch is 23 miles ahead, and in addition to a few technical Challenges between here and there I’m unsure if they’re even open (as are most others I talk to.)
- If they are closed, I’ll need to make it the additional day to VVR. I have three days of food left, but trying to play it smart has me a little hungry at the end of the day. Oh well.

28

- Hit snooze twice for the 5:30 alarm, ended up being along up at 6:30.
- the sun peak up over the distant ridge just as I opened my tent. I felt lazy, but the warm sun was quite a motivator considering my shoes had frozen again overnight.
- today’s pass is Pinchot, one of the mellower passes
- The approach takes you across a very long traverse of a snow field
- It’s difficult to navigate with all the sun cups—everything looks like footsteps.
- Manage to get pretty off to footpath, but then I spot it and begin to head up the ridge to reconnect
- The route is mild compared to others, although this is not to suggest you’d want to slip
- The last hundred feet has you negotiate a cornice. After hopping over is a nice level area to hang out for a bit
- From here I can see the footpath go on for miles in the distance through snow and past frozen lakes. Hard to believe it’s almost July.
- The trail passes a creek (name) and then begins heading downhill to the Kings river, a notorious crossing having taken two lives in 2017, another big snow year
- it’s impossible to follow the trail thru here, bush wacking between sightings of footprints is the only real option
- Finally i reach the edge of the King river and come up with a plan to split the crossing into multiple smaller ones in an area where there are multiple little islands
- It ends up being pretty trivial, but when I walk back to where the trail crosses there is a lot of white water moving extremely fast
- We setup for lunch and to dry things out. Suddenly there is a massive sound. Looking up there are two fighter jets, one tailing the other, screaming through this canyon and banking at 90 degrees.
- We get going, the day has a finite amount of miles as we must wait until tomorrow to cross Mather Pass, perhaps even more frightening a pass than Forester. This is because as the sun hits the pass and warms up the snow it becomes slushy and difficult/dangerous to walk/climb on
- We begin the climb up to the approach, a good 1800ft over 4 miles. Doesn’t sound bad, but the first half is half snow half trail, making navigation incredibly hard, and since it was around 2pm everything was slush
- Eventually the trail and trees entirely disappeared as I’m standing in a field of white which goes on for miles, ending only at the ridge I need to cross tomorrow.
- I now know the true meaning of postholing, as each step either causes me to slip or sink a foot or more. It’s really exhausting to not be able to take a step with confidence over and over.
- after what seems like forever in time and relatively little in miles we arrive at a gravely oasis in the snow. Very flat with room for many tents.
- A group is already there and I go to hang and talk trail as it’s only 4pm.
- I decide to cowboy camp and bundle up with every bit of clothing at my disposable.
- The sky up here is huge, and staring at it as I fall asleep the super high cirrus clouds look so close I could touch them
- I drift off and then wake up as it’s just about dark. Even now there are more stars out than I’ve ever seen before. Jupiter glows brightly, all of the snow around me reflecting the brightness of the stars
- off to my left is the Milky Way, although it looks blocked by some clouds there are still tons of stars
- I wake up later and the celestial sphere has rotated, however those clouds still appear to be blocking part of the Milky Way. It’s only then I realize it’s the dark band of the galaxy, and it only appears so dark due to the contrast with how bright everything else is!
- I fade in and out of sleep all night. Sometimes I open my eyes only to see a shooting star, or a pair of satellites moving in unison
- Unreal

27

- ok nights sleep. Woke up at 6 and got going by 6:45
- Today’s pass is Glenn, which has a rep for being pretty mellow
- Start heading up and run into “stokes”, who camped right at the base
- We start up together and are cruising
- The trail takes you past a massive frozen lake, the deepest blue you can imagine
- We pass some people on the way up and make it to the crest within maybe 20 minutes. That’s not to downplay the pass, it’s pretty serious
- We hang and eventually that group catches up.
- We pick a route which follows a middle line down the snow instead of a steep route down a ridge of rocks
- It’s steady super slushy at 10am and we have to be pretty careful with kicking in footsteps
- The group behind us starts to follow, making me a little nervous as this feels like a pretty aggressive route
- It’s super slow going, and we pass some areas where it is clear people fell then walked their way back over to the route
- We make it down without too much trouble, but the group behind us is falling left and right
- We set up on the rocks below and watch the situation unfold as more people start down the ridge
- Honestly it’s kind of scary to watch people slip and slide down this thing, could easily get yourself into a real bad situation
- Eventually we decide to just get going, and start the long descent to the valley below
- Lots of snow, and pseudo skiing
- Incredibly blue lakes with super freezing water we have to wade through. Surprisingly strong current even tho no white water
- The valley continues to open up as we follow a large river and a huge waterfall emerges in the distance
- We near one of the more notorious water crossings and keep an eye out for alternate spots to cross as we are upstream
- We spot something solid, about waist high and flowing moderately fast, and cross without issue thinking we’re real smart
- We start bush wacking the half mile to the trail when we notice... wait a second, we’re on the wrong side of the water!
- Somehow now we have to cross two distinct streams, both just as involved as the one we had just done
- I find a line and shoot across real quick, stokes follows
- We make it back up to the trail and break for late lunch at 3:30
- After all the redundant crossings and bush wacking a few faces we passed much earlier in the day now pass us. Oh well.
- I dry out my tent as there had been frost all over it in the morning
- We get going again after a quarter hour and continue the descent into the valley
- It’s super wet everywhere. The trail is 1/3 snow, 1/3 stream, 1/3 dry.
- We enter a zone with some huge pines, and before long are at the infamous suspension bridge across woods creek.
- We cross and start the long climb up to just short of Pinot pass, putting us in good position to hit the pass tomorrow morning.
- Following the waterfall up, lots of cool foliage and a nice breeze through the canyon
- Mile 800!
- A decent creek crossing. Some others are trying to scoot along a log, but we spend 30 seconds analyzing a line and powered thru
- Continued the slog up to twin lakes
- Searched around and located two good sites with an incredible view of the lakes and mountains
- Made some Mac and cheese, great sunset
- Very solid day. Tomorrow is an early morning for Pinot, then a very mellow afternoon cruise to set up camp at the base of Mather

- woke up kind of late, after the sun rough creek crossing last night and subsequent freeze I was not eager to get out of the warm quilt.
- unsure if I want to hit forester today, or wait for some of the people I had been hiking with to catch up by taking a trail zero
- Ultimately I decide to at least dry things out and pack things up.
- While doing this I ran into a few familiar faces.
- Not wanting to just sit around all day, I begin hiking towards forester pass, the highest point on the pct and the first major pass.
- If I wasn’t feeling it I’d simply make camp at one of the sites near the base.
- The approach was covered in snow for around 5 miles. Came up behind another hiker and we got to taking.
- Decided to take a break w/ him and his pal. Turned out I was behind Airborne who yoyo’d the PCT last year. His friend was Legend, who had set a number of FKTs including the AZT just before getting here. Damn!
- We hang for a few and then continue our approach to Mather at around 11am. I’m pretty confident to be hitting it with two of the greats.
- Legend leads and starts kicking steps basically straight up the damn thing in nothing but trail runners. No spikes, crampons, ice-axe, etc. Airbore follows and I’m right behind, but with spikes on. It’s like going up a ladder made of snow.
- We’re flying up this thing and passing people doing the switchbacks. We notice a few people at the base begin to follow our aggressive approach and are a little concerned, but fortunately they cross over to the switchbacks before long.
- We teach a rocky outcrop and start basically climbing/scrambling up. The views are insane and we’re having a blast
- We reach the trail and follow a few more dry switchbacks up before hitting the sketchiest part; the chute.
- This thing is near vertical and drops into boulders with tiny footsteps in the snow
- Legend hits it first and kicks in some solid steps, airborne zooms across and I follow not far behind. A quick round of fist bumps and we continue to the apex of the pass.
- Hitting the top we navigate around a cornice and jump over the edge.
- there is plenty of clear ground, quite a change from even a week ago.
- Of course we hang for a little to take it all in. It’s insane up here. Words don’t do it justice.
- We begin eyeing up our route down and decide to take the high line to the left.
- Legend basically starts running this, and it turns out to be super fun as the afternoon sun has made everything quite slushy. You can essentially push with your poles and psuedo-ski down. Too fucking fun!
- We power down to a ridge and walk along the boulders on the top, improvising a route as we descend
- We hit the trail and only stay on it for a moment when Airborne notices some glissade paths. They’re massive.
- He begins down climbing over the edge of the trail. The rocks have melted away some of the snow leaving a descent sheer gap between the start of the glissade and your footing points
- He basically jumps, lands in the chute and starts flying down, at least 800 vertical feet
- I ask legend if he has any tips for someone who has never glissade before. “Pick your route and let go till the end”
- He jumps down and is off
- This leaves me, having never glissaded, about to go for the first time off the tallest pass of the PCT. Fuck it!
- I downclimb, and as I do a smart water bottle falls out of a side pocket on my pack into the sheer gap between the rocks and the snow. Shit! At least it did t have the sawyer on it.
- I carefully negotiate the footing and decide, here it goes.
- speed picks up insanely fast and there is nothing you can do but hope for the best
- I make it to the bottom and stand up with the last little bit of inertia. Stuck the landing! I’m super hyped and can barely see anything with snow spray all over my glasses.
- We continue to basically run down, improvising a route into the valley below.
- We split up, finding our own routes off trail, which was super fun, and run into each other at a small opening in the pines next to the creek, the trail just above our position
- We break for lunch and don’t say much. The day has been too immense. some hikers stop by who I ran into earlier while breaking down camp, they must have had a three hour head start, but here they are catching up at the end of our lunch break!
- We locate a down log to cross the creek, a little sketchy but not as bad as yesterday
- At this point the trail is half dry, half snow. It’s very easy to follow and the surrounding scenery of huge cliffs really is impressive
- We enter an area where earlier this year an avalanche hit. There are tons of huge downed trees, the smell of fresh pine still in the air. Amazing how much power one of these has, snapping towering pines like toothpicks.
- After a few miles we run into a ranger doing permit checks. “Is this all you guys bring with you? You started today where?!”
- Next was a solid slog up to where the trail junctions to kearsarge pass heading off trail. A few miles of a steep grade.
- I have enough food to make it around five or six days, so I’m going to stay on while they exit
- We reach the junction and say goodbye. What an insanely good day.
- I go another mile or so and set up camp pretty early at 7:30pm in an area with no one else around
- It’s nice to cook dinner and watch the clouds turn gold the pink in solitude and think about the day
- I’m reminded of a similarly amazing sunset at Apache Spring in San jacinto. It seems like so long ago. The time on trail ha definitely moved beyond the sense of being relegated to recent memory.
