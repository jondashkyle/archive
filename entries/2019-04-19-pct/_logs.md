- A large downhill section follows, and now the shin really starts acting up. Very slow going.

- sunny sky in morning
- Sar
- Saddle
- First snow

At one of the streams channeling snow melt from the summit I stopped to fill a bottle of water. The sun was ahead of me, and granite downstream from me broke the course of the water, throwing droplets of water into the air and refracting the sun. The water seemed excited or glad to be flowing.

- fuller ridge
- Steep
- Guy slipped
- bought microspikes
- Campsite
- Oracle appearing
- Cold and windy
- Amazing sunset

Looking at the horizon across the sea of clouds I could make out the San Gabriels, my home range in Los Angeles. The snow cap of San Gorgornio was just to the right.

When looking through the gap between two peaks in the ridge the clouds were moving so rapidly as to create the illusion that I and the all of San Jacinto was in motion. Like when you’re at a stoplight and the car next to you begins moving, creating the illusion of you moving backwards.

Amazing day.

-  Walked past an abandon suberb, the tract housing gradating into gridded unlaced roads overtaken by decaying wild flowers from the spring rains.
-  Walking thru the wind farm each turbine had its own pitch and rhythm, the sounds slipping into and out of pulyrthymic phase
-  Fell asleep to the sound of that and the transformers converting the wind into power

- woke up and crossed the shallow forks of Deep Creek and West Fork Mojave River.
- hip felt a little tender
- Scarce water but lovely morning walk. Feels like a stroll starting early, fresh each time
- A little road walk past Ceder Springs Dam. Cool spillway.
- Walk along Silverwood Lake for a few miles, the resivour. Forebay of the California Aqueduct. Flooded a town in the canyon.
- A sign for trail magic
- Trail magic are often well intentioned people, but are a little overwhelming to me. My appetite is intense but my stomach is not huge. Also, this group put a camera in my face immediately and asked for my name and where I’m from. I get it, but I just want to rest for a minute. Still, it was appreciated.
- a bit of a slog out of there, but cool winds from the clouds slipping over the ridge kept me moving. It’s been cloudy in the Los Angeles area the past two days.
- Very few tent sites between here and the 15. Found something flat along a creek and called it a day.
- Read Geoff’s bit on walker lane fault https://www.wired.com/story/walker-lane-move-over-san-andreas-fault/ QUOTATION
- Growing up on the internet. Being in geology and looking at past time scales to try to intuit that of the future

- back up into the clouds. reached a junction with an offshoot down to wrightwood, but decided to continue onward to inspiration point.
- talking to people planning to double zero on saturday and sunday to let this storm system pass. 90% chance of lightning on saturday and a lingering threat on sunday.
- looked into spots to stay in wrightwood. none of them are interesting. almost like storage for furniture no one wants. considering waiting out the storm at home as I’m only 90 minutes from home by car.
- passed the sign for angeles national forest, my home range! (364)
- got to a water source and was talking to someone else walking about feeling as though spending the weekend at home is cheating. “if you’re having fun there is no cheating.”

- just after that it starts to snow, and as i descend it turns to freezing rain.
- meet up at inspiration point and drive some others into town. stop by grizzly cafe for a free coffee and run into some familiar faces.
