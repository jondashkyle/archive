- sunny sky in morning
- Sar
- Saddle
- First snow

At one of the streams channeling snow melt from the summit I stopped to fill a bottle of water. The sun was ahead of me, and granite downstream from me broke the course of the water, throwing droplets of water into the air and refracting the sun. The water seemed excited or glad to be flowing.

- fuller ridge
- Steep
- Guy slipped
- bought microspikes
- Campsite
- Oracle appearing
- Cold and windy
- Amazing sunset

Looking at the horizon across the sea of clouds I could make out the San Gabriels, my home range in Los Angeles. The snow cap of San Gorgornio was just to the right.

When looking through the gap between two peaks in the ridge the clouds were moving so rapidly as to create the illusion that I and the all of San Jacinto was in motion. Like when you’re at a stoplight and the car next to you begins moving, creating the illusion of you moving backwards.

Amazing day.

-  Walking thru the wind farm each turbine had its own pitch and rhythm, the sounds slipping into and out of pulyrthymic phase
-  Fell asleep to the sound of that and the transformers converting the wind into power

- Scarce water but lovely morning walk. Feels like a stroll starting early, fresh each time
- A little road walk past Ceder Springs Dam. Cool spillway.
- Walk along Silverwood Lake for a few miles, the resivour. Forebay of the California Aqueduct. Flooded a town in the canyon.
- A sign for trail magic
- Trail magic are often well intentioned people, but are a little overwhelming to me. My appetite is intense but my stomach is not huge. Also, this group put a camera in my face immediately and asked for my name and where I’m from. I get it, but I just want to rest for a minute. Still, it was appreciated.
- a bit of a slog out of there, but cool winds from the clouds slipping over the ridge kept me moving. It’s been cloudy in the Los Angeles area the past two days.
- Very few tent sites between here and the 15. Found something flat along a creek and called it a day.

- passed the sign for angeles national forest, my home range! (364)
- got to a water source and was talking to someone else walking about feeling as though spending the weekend at home is cheating. “if you’re having fun there is no cheating.”

- As I was heading out of the park to continue a road walk it started to drizzle
- I decided to pause at the structure for the Vasquez Rocks Interpretive Center with its modern steel cantilevered roof and have a look at radar
- I was right on the edge of a storm cell which had popped up over the past 30 minutes, and looked to be strengthening
- Since it was still drizzling, and I appeared to skirt the worst of it, I decided to head out in the light rain for the last mile of walking before hitting town, and a Mexican resteraunt. The prospect of waiting this out over a burrito and margarita was enticing
- After 5 minutes of walking it started to dump rain. Hard. I made the decision to head back, full on sprinting as the rain increased
- I ducked under the roof of the interpretive center for shelter. This was surely an interpretive moment.
- No sooner did I sit down did what can only be described as *clearly* a model and photographer/stylist carrying multiple wardrobes came running out of the rocks. “ITS STARTING TO HAIL, THIS SERIOUSLY HURTS!”
- It continued to pour, then a few kids and their father walked past the center, drenched to the core. He sees me and asks, “Are you on that hike?” “Yeah!” He asked a few questions. “All the way to Canada? That’s amazing!” he said looking at his kids, who at this point were both impatient and confused. I would be too! “I hope you had a fun day here” I said. “We did!”
- A few minutes later two of the kids ran back with. “We wanted to give you this.” A package containing two huge (heavy) ponchos. “Oh geeze, that’s amazing, but I have everything I need with me. Huge thanks though!”
- Trail turned into a swamp horse looking at me like what the fuck shoulder of the road super muddy pocket of sunshine following along
