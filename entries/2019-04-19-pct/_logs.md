- start up to amazing view
- details on the trail from the plaque (desert to laguna seasonal living)
- feeling v good
- Lenticular clouds popping off over mountain waves near jacinto
- dry section of 20 miles so need to fill up at sunrise trail
- Should be looking for “sunrise trail”
- I get to a marker for “sunrise hwy”
- I consult my map and gps, which tells me the water is a few miles further up
- I continue on through easy downhill
- After a while I am certain I should’ve hit the water.
- Look at the map and gps which now tells me I’m 1.75 miles past the junction
- I only had a liter, so I turn around and head back, now all uphill.
- Eat lunch and fill up on 4 liters of water. Notice the clouds have continued to build, now becoming puffy cumulus with grey cloudbases.
- Someone says there is a 10% chance of some rain.
- begin walking a feel a little pain in my left shin from the huffing and puffing to backtrack for water.
- Watching the clouds develop and can see some virga falling which moves my direction and becomes a refreshing sun-shower.
- A large downhill section follows, and now the shin really starts acting up. Very slow going.
- This is followed by a modest section of extremely up, which is a relief as the stress is on there when arching my foot downwards.
- Coyotes as the sun set

- didn’t realize another tent had been set up next time me during the rain, and the owner turned out to snore like a bear, which was a real surprise.
