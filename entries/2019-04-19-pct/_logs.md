- First snow

At one of the streams channeling snow melt from the summit I stopped to fill a bottle of water. The sun was ahead of me, and granite downstream from me broke the course of the water, throwing droplets of water into the air and refracting the sun. The water seemed excited or glad to be flowing.

- fuller ridge

- Campsite
- Oracle appearing
- Cold and windy
- Amazing sunset

Looking at the horizon across the sea of clouds I could make out the San Gabriels, my home range in Los Angeles. The snow cap of San Gorgornio was just to the right.

When looking through the gap between two peaks in the ridge the clouds were moving so rapidly as to create the illusion that I and the all of San Jacinto was in motion. Like when you’re at a stoplight and the car next to you begins moving, creating the illusion of you moving backwards.

Amazing day.

-  Walking thru the wind farm each turbine had its own pitch and rhythm, the sounds slipping into and out of pulyrthymic phase
-  Fell asleep to the sound of that and the transformers converting the wind into power

- A little road walk past Ceder Springs Dam. Cool spillway.
- Walk along Silverwood Lake for a few miles, the resivour. Forebay of the California Aqueduct. Flooded a town in the canyon.
- A sign for trail magic
- Trail magic are often well intentioned people, but are a little overwhelming to me. My appetite is intense but my stomach is not huge. Also, this group put a camera in my face immediately and asked for my name and where I’m from. I get it, but I just want to rest for a minute. Still, it was appreciated.
- a bit of a slog out of there, but cool winds from the clouds slipping over the ridge kept me moving. It’s been cloudy in the Los Angeles area the past two days.
- Very few tent sites between here and the 15. Found something flat along a creek and called it a day.

- As I was heading out of the park to continue a road walk it started to drizzle
- I decided to pause at the structure for the Vasquez Rocks Interpretive Center with its modern steel cantilevered roof and have a look at radar
- I was right on the edge of a storm cell which had popped up over the past 30 minutes, and looked to be strengthening
- Since it was still drizzling, and I appeared to skirt the worst of it, I decided to head out in the light rain for the last mile of walking before hitting town, and a Mexican resteraunt. The prospect of waiting this out over a burrito and margarita was enticing
- After 5 minutes of walking it started to dump rain. Hard. I made the decision to head back, full on sprinting as the rain increased
- I ducked under the roof of the interpretive center for shelter. This was surely an interpretive moment.
- No sooner did I sit down did what can only be described as *clearly* a model and photographer/stylist carrying multiple wardrobes came running out of the rocks. “ITS STARTING TO HAIL, THIS SERIOUSLY HURTS!”
- It continued to pour, then a few kids and their father walked past the center, drenched to the core. He sees me and asks, “Are you on that hike?” “Yeah!” He asked a few questions. “All the way to Canada? That’s amazing!” he said looking at his kids, who at this point were both impatient and confused. I would be too! “I hope you had a fun day here” I said. “We did!”
- A few minutes later two of the kids ran back with. “We wanted to give you this.” A package containing two huge (heavy) ponchos. “Oh geeze, that’s amazing, but I have everything I need with me. Huge thanks though!”

- Stop at the diner
- REI
- Resupply
- Super hot, but forecast is to be 10 degrees hotter in two days. Waited around until 1:15 to start to let some heat pass.
- One of the biggest differences with being back on the trail versus being at home is how you go from staring at things a foot in front of you at home versus looking miles into the distance on the trail and how that affects your perception of environmen
- Pack feels good, things a little sore from the break. Also got a super huge resupply and way too much water to simulate being in the Sierra with this pack.
- Decided not to push too hard, so started shopping for sites around 6:30
- Set up camp in a dry sandy secluded spot off the trail. All to myself.

- Had a local brew called “the gathering” which had a label containing Vasquez Rocks and a mountain lion
- Was planning to head out at 3, but then heard rumors of a taco salad dinner
- Decided to stay for the evening. Although I’m not super interested in the culture, I’m never going to be back through here, and these sorts of places thin out by the time you finish the desert. Also, an extra half day here is an extra half day of snow melt up north

- last night felt like I may almost have a mild head cold. Nose issues and a cough. Took a while to get to sleep
- got going at 4:30am. glad for first full day back on trail.
- Amazing sunrise
- Really interesting trail following rolling sandstone
- The first several miles followed the north face and had dense foliage overhead
- quickly began warming up
- Filling up on water, jerry rigging the trekking pole 
- Decided to pause at an area with tall pines and a great view for a siesta around 10:30am
- left around 1:30pm
- trail crosses to the south face and quickly turned into brush. super hot.
- Passed mile 500!
- This was the first day where the bugs were really bad.
- Attempted to fill up on water again. One cistern had a decomosing bear in it. Another was guarded by a swarm of bees. Finally there was a camp with a stream near by, but it was a 300 yard scramble down, and wanting to keep moving I passed.
- However, there was a small stream indicated as only another 3 miles ahead, and I had around 1L left.
- Got there and the stream was now a trickle, again guarded by bees.
- I got maybe half a liter and decided enough is enough.
- The next stretch took you into private property, a winter hunting club.
- This was the most difficult section of trail yet. The path nonsensically meanders for eight miles a distance which should only take 1.5 miles.
- This is to avoid the trail running through their property.
- At times the trail is extremely steep for not apparent reason
- My conclusion is that they allow the pct to go through the property, but made the path so miserable as to guarantee only thru hikers will ever be there.
- Because I was down to almost no water I pushed into “hiker town”, another one of these scrappy hiker accommodations. I wanted to avoid this, but the water made it nessecarry to stay, as what follows is a 20mi dry stretch along the desert floor.
- Camped behind some of the small structures with the sounds of the highway annoyingly close
- Difficult day all in all; looking forward to taking it easy and mapping tomorrow afternoon I preparation for beginning the aguqduct in the late evening tomorrow.

- Cruising up through rolling hills, two primary peaks ahead of us
- Reach the first one and head down to a spring below as the sun comes up
- We begin heading up the next larger peak
- I’m moving a bit faster after having had another instant coffee and carnation breakfast blend
- I hit the steepest section as the sun begins climb above the ridge and heat everything up
- Although the sunrise was a big motivator, it’s now a bit oppressive as the tiredness starts to kick in
- After the big push up in stopped for a break. Sure enough daway catches up after around 20 minutes and we continue up to the very peak
- A fire road runs near here, and someone had bothered to bring some big red umbrellas, chairs, and a lot of water to the top. We took a nice 15 minute break here, relived that it was all downhill from here 
- major slog, two big ants fightint
- Big winding downhill section to the road, lots of switchbacks and very little shade heading into the windmills
- Arrive At 2:30pm and daway follows after a few minutes
- Head to the road and manage to hitch into town from someone meeting up with another hiker, Can of soda in the car
- Get a room in a hotel, shower up, grab a pizza and a beer, and get to sleep by 6:00

- hotel etc
- Hitch out w dick
- Wiiiiiind blowing me off trail
- Jon and cars hitch
- Head up a few miles in to a site on a ridge
- This area is notoriously windy, so I find a site which appears to have good coverage
- No sooner did I make camp did the wind shift with the setting sun and now it’s unbearable
- I take down my tent and use it as a ground sheet to cowboy camp in a group of Joshua trees
- Looking up and seeing the stars, the city in the distance
- The gusting wind made it impossible to sleep as I kept shifting me around and hitting my face
- Decided this is no longer sleep and is instead just a relaxing break

- slept in till 8, felt amazing
- started with a brief climb and continued into even denser pines. 
- filled up at a water source after 5 miles
- A few miles later a super lush canyon in the distance revealed a stream with great flow, the first such one in many many miles
- After passing a few I noticed a rock with the perfect incline adjacent a small pool of water in the stream
- Stopped and did some foot maintence and dipped my toes in. Freezing!
- Static Stopped by and I asked him about his name. He did the entire PCT in 2015 and carried an am radio with him. He’d walk by people and it’s sometimes just be static. Amazing.
- Continued on and the pines eventually returned to chaperel
- On the hot downhill section off the mountain I listed to an episode of the brain science podcast about again well. After 45 minutes the guest goes on to say, “honestly the  best thing for against thing is walking.” Got a good laugh out of me.
- Arrived at the critical water cache and forgot my trekking pole, had to backtrack maybe 150 yards to get it
- This is the most desert-like part of the entire trail. Super dry, incredibly desolate. Got up to 104 degrees down here today.
- I was surprised to have not seen anyone for during this next few miles, as usually late in the day you’ll pass people setting up camp
- I kept pushing on to see if I’d run into anyone, and noticed some cow pies on the ground, a feature of the past hundred miles. I thought about how odd it was I hadn’t seen any cattle.
- No sooner did I note that did maybe 15 cows appear ahead of me directly on trail. They all turned to look as I rounded the corner.
- I had to go off trail to go around them, ironically enough following cow trails through the brush.
- Over the next few miles I still didn’t come across anyone, and at this point there are no man-made features around, other than the trail
- I begin to feel super isolated out here
- I push to a marked campsite and sure enough, no one was there. At this point it was almost entirely dark, although the moon was full and just peeking above the horizon
- I noticed a report on the camp sites that there is cell service at the top of the hill, so I keep pushing and notice a few camp sites, too, however the coverage is somewhat poor and it’s very windy on the ridge
- I make camp and try calling, but reception is very spotty and the call keeps dropping

- water cache help
- Big slog up
- Incredible view of the Sierra
- Back into some pines
- Big thunderheads forming
- difficult day
- Thinking about making it a section
- All sorts of doubt
- Listening to the Stanford biology of human social behavior, maybe not the best for walking the desert alone
- Got to walker pass and the plan was to continue to Kennedy Meadows, camp just past the trailhead
- Instead, I was feeling pretty mentally exhausted. Someone there had just dropped off a group and offered to drive me into Kernville
- I impulsively took him up on the offer
- He was born in onyx and worked for 35 years for the forest service marking forest sales
- Got a drink with him at the kern brewery
- Awesome guy
- Walked next door to the kern lodge and got a great room with a hiker discount
- Already Feeling much better

16

- I woke up and got breakfast at Cheryl’s diner.
- Still a lot of thoughts going through my head about making this a section hike
- Called someone who I was pacing with for a while who was section hiking but forced to get off trail due to shin splints
- He gave me a lot of wisdom
- Decided I’ll push at least to Kennedy Meadows before deciding
- Considered leaving this afternoon, but more thunderheads were forming
- Decided to get lunch and see how I felt about staying another night for a full zero
- Got lunch at Ewing’s on the Kern. Awesome view from the patio of storms forming. Saw lightning on the ridge while eating salmon.
- got to talking to a couple
- Decided to stay an extra night, even though the bus to the trailhead left super early at 5am
- Great day and feeling recharged

17

- My alarm went off at 4am and I began packing up, but then a premonition of the bus for some reason not arriving, and me having no way back to the hotel came to my mind. I later found out I was right as the bus doesn’t run on Tuesday!
- I decided to get my money’s worth and sleep in
- Woke up and checked out around 10am, got breakfast at the Cracked Egg. Honestly some of the best pancakes of my life. Perfect texture and sponginess.
- My ride to the trail fell through at noon
- Ran into daway who I did the aqueduct with.
- Ended up catching up and decided to split a room
- Lazy evenjng
