- begin walking a feel a little pain in my left shin from the huffing and puffing to backtrack for water.
- Watching the clouds develop and can see some virga falling which moves my direction and becomes a refreshing sun-shower.
- A large downhill section follows, and now the shin really starts acting up. Very slow going.

- sunny sky in morning
- Sar
- Saddle
- First snow

At one of the streams channeling snow melt from the summit I stopped to fill a bottle of water. The sun was ahead of me, and granite downstream from me broke the course of the water, throwing droplets of water into the air and refracting the sun. The water seemed excited or glad to be flowing.

- fuller ridge
- Steep
- Guy slipped
- bought microspikes
- Campsite
- Oracle appearing
- Cold and windy
- Amazing sunset

Looking at the horizon across the sea of clouds I could make out the San Gabriels, my home range in Los Angeles. The snow cap of San Gorgornio was just to the right.

When looking through the gap between two peaks in the ridge the clouds were moving so rapidly as to create the illusion that I and the all of San Jacinto was in motion. Like when you’re at a stoplight and the car next to you begins moving, creating the illusion of you moving backwards.

Amazing day.

-  Started to get jello legs towards the bottom
-  Reached the desert floor, continuing along past an extremely Palm Springs development and into a dry wash
-  Huge winds and walking in loose sand parellrling the 10 for 6 miles
-  Reached an underpass where there was some water
-  Decided to push on another 4 miles to a wind turbine farm adjacent the pct where they let you set up camp
-  Walked past an abandon suberb, the tract housing gradating into gridded unlaced roads overtaken by decaying wild flowers from the spring rains.
-  Walking thru the wind farm each turbine had its own pitch and rhythm, the sounds slipping into and out of pulyrthymic phase
-  Fell asleep to the sound of that and the transformers converting the wind into power
