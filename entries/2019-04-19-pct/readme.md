# Pacific Crest Trail, 2019

I’m going on a walk of the Pacific Crest Trail, a 2650mi path beginning at the Mexican border and ending at the Canadian border and running through California, Oregon, and Washington.

Along the way I’ll be logging brief entries, which can be viewed on [this dedicated page](/pct). 

{SCREENSHOT}

The map updates live each day with fresh aerial imagery from the [VIIRS](https://ncc.nesdis.noaa.gov/VIIRS/) satellite. Zooming in far enough switches to a shaded relief tile. Markers are positioned to indicate the terminuses (solid white) and the campsite for each day (outlined black), while the most recent position is indicated by a red outline. There are no borders or other points of reference to identify position or scale.

- In doing research for the trip I’ve seen so much imagery. Daily updates will contain a single photo and mostly text.
