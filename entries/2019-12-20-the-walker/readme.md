linktext: Read on The Walker

The Walker was kind enough to ask [me to contribute](https://walkerart.org/magazine/2019-the-year-according-to-jon-kyle) to their annual “Year According to” list. Most of my year was spent walking, so I elaborated on that, James Benning, visiting the Setouchi Triennale in Japan, and good music.

It meant a lot to be included. The Walker is a consistent favorite. Be sure to read some of the other lists, too.
