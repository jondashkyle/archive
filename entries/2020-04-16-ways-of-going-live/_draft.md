# Ways of Going Live

- Focus on three directions

- Using streaming platforms
- Using service APIs
- Rolling your own server


- 15 minutes describing each solution
- Q&A afterwards

### Platforms

- Instagram does not let you use streaming software, however there are [private APIs](https://github.com/dilame/instagram-private-api) which make this possible, however I have had issues with interim disconnects.

- Use existing video embed w/ custom chat. Disable on the platform.

#### Expenses

### Service API

- Mux
	- The self professed “Stripe of live streaming”.
	- Really solid API. Offloads all the hard stuff.
	- A demo using Glitch.
	- It’s what this is using
	- Built in archiving
	- Solid transcoding pipeline
	- Reasonable rates
	- Offering to wave fees for events impacted by COVID.
