Hey there,

A little late, but happy fall for those in the northern hemisphere, and I suppose happy spring for all of those in the southern! A few happenings since last time.

## Why¿

Why¿ is a ![non-place for inquiry](https://wwhhyy.space). In time things will become clearer, but for now, expect to ask what (essays, interviews, observations) and when (livestreams, workshops, relaxed events).

The first livestream, [*On Public Parks and Open Networks*](https://www.wwhhyy.space/entries/network-park), will take place on Monday December 10th at 10am PST.</p>

## London Calling

The first two Why¿ hangs were back in October in London. My friends from Code for Science and Society, who are behind the Dat protocol, invited me to lead a workshop at MozFest 2018. The following evening I stopped by [Evening Class](https://evening-class.org), which you should check out if unfamiliar, to provide an option for some of those unable to attend the conference.

We leave behind an archive containing hours of talks given by participants at hangouts in Los Angeles, New York City, and Berlin. They range in topic, but have in common a hopeful speculation of possible futures, online, offline, and that liminal space inbetween.
