  <p>Hey there,</p>
  <p>Somehow itâ€™s the end of the year. Hope everyone is closing the decade (?!) on a high note. Some of whatâ€™s been going on, and whatâ€™s to come:</p>

    <h2>1. I hiked the Pacific Crest Trail</h2>
    <a href="https://www.jon-kyle.com/entries/2019-11-18-pct"><figure><img src="https://api.jon-kyle.com/mailinglist/2019-12-01-kawara/pct.jpeg?nf_resize=fit&w=1800&h=1800"></figure></a>
    <p>Over four months during the past summer I hiked from the border of Mexico and California to the border of Washington and Canada, a total of 2650 miles along the Pacific Crest Trail. The PCT follows the backbone of three mountain ranges; the Transverse, the Sierra, and the Cascades.</p>
    <p>I completed the trail on September 20th, walking continuously northbound and connecting (minus maybe one or two) all of my steps. Iâ€™m still processing, and will likely continue to for some time. It was life changing.</p>

    <h2>2. A new project; Kawara</h2>
    <a href="https://www.jon-kyle.com/entries/2019-11-18-pct"><figure><img src="https://api.jon-kyle.com/mailinglist/2019-12-01-kawara/kawara.jpeg?nf_resize=fit&w=1800&h=1800"></figure></a>
    <p>The Pacific Crest Trail taught me a lot, and Iâ€™m eager to apply some of what to future projects. When describing my time on trail, I often say the defining motif was just how much time there was to think about time. With this in mind, itâ€™s time to say goodbye to a previous project, and hello to a new one.</p>

    <p>Also: to any friends who have considered collaboration in the past, but timing didnâ€™t line up, the first few months of the year are looking good. Letâ€™s catch up.</p>
    <p>Thatâ€™s it for now. Thanks for taking the time, and hereâ€™s to the next decade ðŸ¥‚</p>
